Additionally, we highlight promising therapeutic approaches such as fecal microbiota transplantation, microbial metabolite-based interventions, and nanotherapeutics. We further discuss how genetic insights and immune biomarkers can facilitate treatment personalization and improve prognostic stratification.

Understanding the relationship between hepcidin and IBD is essential to improving the diagnosis and management of this complication. This article aimed to systematically review and synthesize the evidence on the associative and predictive utility of hepcidin as a biomarker for inflammatory activity, iron status, and anemia management in patients with IBD.\nA systematic review (SR) (PROSPERO identification number: CRD42024375586) was conducted across the databases PubMed, PubMed PMC, BVS/BIREME, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, EBSCOhost, and ProQuest, including studies published up to July 2024. The research question was structured using the PICO strategy (Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) to guide study selection and analysis.

Secondary outcomes included clinical response, endoscopic remission, endoscopic response, endoscopic improvement, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and infections. Ranking was assessed using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probabilities. Ritlecitinib exhibited the highest SUCRA probabilities for clinical remission (88.7%), clinical response (86.0%), and endoscopic improvement (92.1%). Upadacitinib exhibited superiority in endoscopic remission (85.6%) and response (99.5%), demonstrating moderate efficacy in clinical response (82.2%).

Both host genetic variants and the gut microbiome can affect host gene expression in the colon; however, it remains unclear whether interactions between the two (genotype x microbiome, GxM) shape intestinal gene regulation in humans and their contribution to IBD risk.\nWe analyzed publicly available data for 86 individuals (64 patients with IBD and 22 controls) in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Database consisting of host genotype, host gene expression, and mucosal gut microbiome (16S rRNA) data from rectal and ileum biopsies. We performed expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping and then used computational fine-mapping to identify likely causal variants. We tested whether microbial taxa modify genetic effects on host gene expression.

A literature search was performed using PubMed and reviewed references from applicable manuscripts between 2005 and June 2025.\nCumulative evidence suggests that proactive TDM plays a key role in guiding anti-TNF therapy de-escalation, as in patients with supra-therapeutic drug concentrations and discontinuation of the IMM in case of combination therapy with infliximab, as in patients with high drug concentrations prior to IMM withdrawal. Moreover, preliminary data suggest that proactive TDM may also help guiding anti-TNF therapy withdrawal, as in patients with sustained remission and undetectable or low drug concentrations at the time of drug discontinuation. Finally, proactive TDM is also important for surveillance of patients after treatment de-escalation to prevent low drug concentrations and immunogenicity.

Eligible instrumental variables were screened from previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of European ancestry for analysis. The inverse variance-weighted method was used for the primary analysis. Sensitivity analyses were used to detect and correct pleiotropy. LDSC analysis determined SNP-based heritability (h2) for acute appendicitis, IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC). Following that, cross-trait LDSC analysis assessed genetic correlations (rg) between these traits using GWAS summary data.\nGenetically predicted UC was significantly associated with a lower risk of acute appendicitis (OR = 0.933, 95% CI 0.911-0.957, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and appendectomy (OR = 0.954, 95% CI 0.932-0.976, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Conversely, no causal effect was observed from acute appendicitis or appendectomy on IBD, UC, or CD.

Although as common as rheumatoid arthritis, awareness and screening questioning for axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis in musculoskeletal clinical practice is not yet core clinical practice and likely to be contributing to delays in diagnosis.\nThe masterclass aims to increase awareness of the clinical features and risk factors that raise suspicion that persistent back, joint or tendon problems may be axial or peripheral spondyloarthritis. Guidance is provided on the updated inflammatory screening questioning important within musculoskeletal assessments, and for developing clinical knowledge and skills to support assessment for spondylarthritis, suspicion and referral to rheumatology. Clinical assessments need to question and examine for signs, symptoms and risk factors for both axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis. This involves screening for clinical features of inflammatory back pain, enthesitis, dactylitis, joint pain and swelling; prolonged morning stiffness; risk factors of psoriasis or family history of psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) -Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, uveitis, and family history of inflammatory arthritis. Referral criteria support clinical reasoning on levels of suspicion and when to refer to rheumatology.\nSpondyloarthritis has been under-recognised in musculoskeletal assessments, which can have significant consequences for disease progression, complications and quality of life.

Despite significant advances in IBD pharmacotherapy, patients often experience treatment failures due to suboptimal treatment responses, frequent relapses, and are also susceptible to developing several adverse effects (AEs), highlighting the need for developing alternative therapies. A growing body of evidence necessitates the importance of maintaining gut microbiome homeostasis, which is commonly disrupted in IBD. Probiotics have emerged as promising adjunctive IBD therapies due to their capacity to modulate immune responses, restore gut microbial balance, and preserve mucosal barrier integrity. Multiple probiotic strains, including Escherichia coli (E. coli) Nissle 1917, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum), Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii (S. boulardii), and combination formulations, such as VSL#3 (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus thermophilus), have demonstrated superior efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in comparison with placebo and comparable efficacy with conventional treatments, such as mesalazine. While the efficacy of probiotics has been demonstrated in UC through several clinical studies, evidence supporting their use in CD remains inconsistent, with studies yielding mixed or inconclusive results. This highlights the necessity for additional carefully designed, large-scale studies specifically targeting CD patients to better understand the therapeutic potential of probiotics in a broader context.

The primary outcome was treatment persistence at up to 12\u2009months post-switch. Secondary outcomes included relapse rate (defined as Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] \u2009\u226510/ weighted PCDAI\u2009 \u2265 12.5 with biochemical/endoscopic evidence of disease activity), IFX trough levels, immunogenicity, safety, and acceptance.\nSixty-six patients switched to SC-IFX (48% males; median switch-age, 16.5\u2009years; IQR, 14.9-17.3 years; median switch-weight, 60\u2009kg; range, 13-102\u2009kg), 41/66 (62%) with Crohn Disease. Pre-switch, the median IV-IFX maintenance dose was 10\u2009mg/kg every 6 weeks; 58/66 patients (88%) were in clinical remission.

Relapses were observed in 11/66 patients (17%) over a median follow-up of 11.0\u2009months (IQR, 5.1-12.0); 6 patients underwent SC-IFX dose intensification, with 3 successfully regaining clinical response. Regarding anti-drug antibodies (ADA), 3 out of 4 patients who were ADA positive on IV-IFX resolved post-switch.

High levels of stress, anxiety, and depression are common yet often overlooked, negatively impacting treatment adherence and self-care. This review examines how psychological factors influence self-care behaviors in IBD and explores strategies to improve disease management. Following PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024575631), this systematic review applied the PICO model to identify studies involving IBD patients, self-care interventions, and outcomes related to depression, anxiety and stress. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, APA PsycInfo and Google Scholar (October-December 2024). JBI tools were used to assess risk of bias, and evidence was graded using the framework established by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Data extraction and synthesis were performed using structured tables and graphs. IBD patients frequently experience psychological distress that impairs self-care and quality of life. Depression is associated with low self-efficacy and maladaptive coping, while anxiety reduces treatment adherence, particularly in younger patients. Stress contributes to disease management difficulties, reinforcing the need for integrated psychological support. Psychological distress in IBD patients significantly affects self-care behaviors.

The most prominent manifestations of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC is characterized by a continuous pattern that commonly starts with lesions in rectum mucosa and is contained in the colon. On the other hand, CD affects the ileum and colon in a discontinuous pattern, and the lesions are often transmural. Conventional therapies often face limitations such as systemic side effects, poor drug stability, and low site-specificity. In recent years, nanoparticle (NP) systems have emerged as a promising strategy to overcome these challenges, offering improved targeting, controlled release, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Several studies have shown that the preferential accumulation of NPs in the inflamed colon is influenced by the pathophysiological changes associated with IBD, including alterations in transit time, pH value, enzymatic activity, microbial composition, and mucus integrity. These disease-specific characteristics provide unique opportunities to design smart and responsive NPs that enhance drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic exposure.

IBD, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a group of chronic gastrointestinal disorders with an increasing global incidence. Despite extensive research, the exact etiopathogenesis remains elusive, although a complex interplay involving genetic predisposition, environmental influences, and abnormal immune responses against commensal gut microbes is widely recognized. SCFAs, primarily acetate and butyrate, emerge as key microbial metabolites derived from the fermentation of dietary fiber. They exert profound effects on gut homeostasis, notably with butyrate serving as an essential energy source for colonocytes, strengthening epithelial integrity, actively modulating local and systemic immune functions, suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and enhancing mucosal defense mechanisms.

We have recently shown that a systemic deficiency of taurine, a semi-essential amino acid with anti-inflammatory properties, marks IBD. To characterize the temporal dynamics and determinants of taurine deficiency in IBD, we conducted a prospective longitudinal study assessing serum taurine levels in a cohort of 47 patients with IBD compared with 33 healthy controls. Serum taurine concentrations were measured at baseline and after a median follow-up period of 45 months using ELISA. Patients were stratified by disease subtype (UC and CD), age group, and clinical activity status at baseline and follow-up. Serum taurine levels were significantly lower in IBD patients at both baseline and the end of follow-up (", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2026-01-28", "authors": ["RacheleFrascatani", "AdelaideMattogno", "SilviaSalvatori", "AndreaIannucci", "IreneMarafini", "GiovanniMonteleone"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms27020725"}
{"title": "Subclass-Aware Contrastive Semi-Supervised Learning for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Classification from Colonoscopy Images.", "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The accurate classification of IBD from colonoscopy images is critical for diagnosis and treatment. However, the lack of labeled data poses a major challenge for developing deep learning-based IBD classification approaches. Recently, pseudo-labeling-based semi-supervised learning methods offer a promising solution in leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to improve classification performance. Nevertheless, due to significant intra-class variability and the subtle inter-class differences in IBD colonoscopy images, pseudo-labels are often inaccurate, which results in confirmation bias and suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, a Subclass-Aware Contrastive Semi-Supervised Learning method, referred to as SACSSL, is proposed for accurate IBD classification by integrating a subclass-aware contrastive module into a pseudo-labeling-based semi-supervised framework, e.g., FixMatch. Specifically, unlabeled samples are first partitioned into confident and uncertain samples according to the confidence of pseudo-labels. An instance-level contrastive loss is then applied to uncertain samples, aiming to mitigate confirmation bias. Furthermore, intra-class heterogeneity is captured by introducing a set of prototypes for each subclass and assigning confident samples to these prototypes to form fine-grained subclasses, and supervised contrastive loss is applied to promote intra-subclass clustering, thereby enhancing inter-class separability while preserving intra-class diversity. Our method is evaluated on two datasets, i.e., an in-house collected Daping dataset for IBD classification and a publicly available LIMUC dataset for UC severity grading. On both datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under the semi-supervised setting. Specifically, with only 20% labeled data, the proposed method reaches an overall accuracy of 93.2% and an F1-score of 80.1% on the Daping dataset, which is close to the fully supervised upper bound (94.0% accuracy and 80.8% F1-score), and it achieves an overall accuracy of 76.4% and an F1-score of 68.9% on the LIMUC dataset.

{"title": "Optimizing Drug Positioning in IBD: Clinical Predictors, Biomarkers, and Practical Approaches to Personalized Therapy.", "abstract": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), which include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic, immune-mediated disorders marked by persistent and recurrent inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Over the past two decades, major advances in understanding the immunologic and molecular pathways that drive intestinal injury have transformed the therapeutic landscape. This progress has enabled the development of novel biologics and small-molecule agents that more precisely target dysregulated immune responses, thereby improving clinical outcomes and quality of life for many patients. Despite these therapeutic advances, IBD remains a highly heterogeneous condition. Patients differ widely in disease phenotype, progression, and response to specific treatments. Consequently, selecting the most effective therapy for an individual patient requires careful consideration of clinical features, molecular markers, and prior treatment history. The shift toward personalized, prediction-based treatment strategies aims to optimize the timing and choice of therapy, minimize unnecessary exposure to ineffective drugs, and ultimately alter the natural course of disease. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of current evidence guiding drug positioning in IBD, with particular emphasis on biologic therapies and small-molecule inhibitors. We also examine emerging biomarkers, clinical predictors of response, and real-world factors that influence therapeutic decision-making. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations that continue to hinder widespread implementation of personalized strategies, underscoring the need for further research to integrate precision medicine into routine IBD care.", "journal": "Biomedicines", "date": "2026-01-28", "authors": ["IreneMarafini", "SilviaSalvatori", "AntonioFonsi", "GiovanniMonteleone"], "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines14010191"}

Therefore, this Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is intended to provide Best Practice Advice on the evaluation and management of hospitalized adult patients with IBD. We have developed Best Practice Advice statements to address 13 key clinical issues.\nThis Expert Review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Prompt hospitalization should be considered for adult patients with IBD who present with severe disease refractory to outpatient treatment when there is high suspicion for an IBD-related complication, such as intestinal obstruction or intra-abdominal abscess, or when there is significant nutritional risk or failure to thrive. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: The initial management of hospitalized adult patients with IBD should include supportive care. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: The initial management of hospitalized adult patients with IBD should include an evaluation for IBD-related complications and concomitant infections. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Hospitalized adult patients with IBD should have their disease activity assessed with both biomarkers and endoscopic evaluation, when indicated. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Hospitalized adult patients with IBD should receive prophylactic anticoagulation for prevention of venous thromboembolism. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Hospitalized adult patients with severe ulcerative colitis should be counseled on the potential need for colectomy and should have a timely referral for surgical consultation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Hospitalized adult patients with severe ulcerative colitis should receive initial treatment with intravenous corticosteroids at a methylprednisolone 60-mg daily dose equivalent. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Hospitalized adult patients with severe ulcerative colitis should be monitored for treatment response within 72 hours of medical treatment initiation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Preparations should be made for initiating rescue therapy in hospitalized adult patients with severe ulcerative colitis who are not responsive to intravenous corticosteroid treatment. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: In hospitalized adult patients with Crohn's disease and intestinal obstruction, medical treatment with intravenous corticosteroids should be considered when there is evidence of active inflammation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: In hospitalized adult patients with Crohn's disease and an intra-abdominal abscess, treatment should include infection control with abscess drainage (depending on size and location) and systemic antibiotics, as well as decision making regarding further medical or surgical management.

{"title": "[Consensus document on healthy lifestyles].", "abstract": "Proteins are a group of macronutrients that are vital to our lives, as they perform various functions, including structural, defensive and catalytic. An intake of 1.0-1.2 g/kg/body weight per day would be sufficient to meet our needs. Carbohydrate requirements constitute 50 % of the total caloric value and should be obtained mainly in the form of complex carbohydrates. In addition, a daily intake of both soluble and insoluble fiber is necessary. Regular consumption of extra virgin olive oil is an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Its inclusion in the Mediterranean diet strengthens its protective effect, positioning it as a key food in health promotion. Daily consumption is recommended as a substitute for saturated and processed fats to maximise its benefits. Salt is involved in the control and intensity of high blood pressure, kidney damage in the form of altered urinary albumin excretion, and damage to other target organs, especially in salt-sensitive patients. Potassium lowers blood pressure through its vasodilatory and natriuretic effects, which reduces events and mortality. The consumption of alcoholic beverages in general is harmful to health, although a certain protection against the development of acute myocardial infarction has been observed in association with low consumption and a pattern of intake with meals and from middle age onwards. The recommendation for total abstinence is essential among the young population. Among drinkers over the age of 50, consumption should be limited to one UBE per day (10 g of alcohol) for women and up to two for men. Moderate coffee consumption (up to 3-5 cups per day) is recommended from a cardiovascular point of view, as it has shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which are associated with a lower risk of arrhythmias and cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction and stroke, compared to not consuming it. To obtain this benefit, it should be consumed in the morning. Chocolate acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, improving endothelial function, blood pressure, lipid profile and platelet function. Consumed in excess, it can have negative effects on several levels, such as weight gain, stimulant effects and added sugar consumption. Mediterranean-type diets, with their variants (DASH, Atlantic and Nordic), have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits and advocate moderate and balanced food consumption. They all favour the use of fresh, seasonal and local foods, avoiding saturated fats, refined and processed products and sugary drinks. Vegetarian or vegan diets and intermittent fasting have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits, but can lead to nutrient deficiencies or pose risks during pregnancy, breastfeeding, growth or in patients with diabetes, so professional advice should be sought. Physical exercise has enormous benefits for individual and collective health. Regular exercise is associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, some cancers, depression, and cognitive decline. The minimum recommendations for physical exercise (150 min/week) should be met or exceeded. Social relationships are key determinants of health. Individuals are social agents capable of changing norms and behaviours in their environment. Family and partner support and interpersonal interactions are fundamental to the development of emotional skills, resilience and self-care. Adequate night-time rest is essential for maintaining good physical and mental health. Early detection and treatment of sleep disorders can improve patients' quality of life and prevent cardiovascular, metabolic, oncological and psychiatric diseases. Addictive behaviours have an impact on the cardiovascular health of those who suffer from them. Healthy lifestyle medicine is an essential tool, not only for treating these conditions, but also for preventing them. Sexual and reproductive health is closely linked to cardiovascular risk. Hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidaemia, smoking and stress negatively affect both fertility and sexual function, but advanced age also reduces fertility, and obesity and smoking aggravate reproductive and cardiovascular risks. Fertility treatment, in general, has not been shown to increase long-term cardiovascular risk, although it may increase short-term complications. Some drugs for cardiovascular disease can affect both sexual and reproductive function. Chronic stress can act as a trigger and amplifier of underlying cardiovascular processes. The deleterious effects of stress are exacerbated if they coexist with other risk factors, such as a sedentary lifestyle, poor sleep quality, or social isolation. It is important to identify whether the stress comes from work, family or financial circumstances. To control it, relaxation techniques should be applied, structured physical exercise should be encouraged, social support should be promoted, adequate sleep hygiene should be maintained, and limits should be set and tasks prioritised. Environmental pollution is one of the main environmental risks to human health, with a particular impact on the cardiovascular system. Air pollutants include particles and gases that, depending on their composition and size, can penetrate deep into the body. Fine (PM2.5) and ultrafine (PM0.1) particles are particularly dangerous because of their ability to induce systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction.\nLas prote\u00ednas son un grupo de macronutrientes vitales en nuestras vidas, pues realizan distintas funciones, entre las que destacan la estructural, la defensiva o la catal\u00edtica. Un aporte de 1,0-1,2 g/kg/ peso al d\u00eda ser\u00eda suficiente para cubrir nuestras necesidades. Los requerimientos de carbohidratos constituyen un 50 % del valor cal\u00f3rico total y deben obtenerse en su mayor\u00eda en forma de hidratos de carbono complejos. Adem\u00e1s, se necesita un aporte diario de fibra, tanto soluble como insoluble. El consumo regular de aceite de oliva virgen extra es una estrategia eficaz para la prevenci\u00f3n de enfermedades cardiovasculares, metab\u00f3licas y neurodegenerativas. Su inclusi\u00f3n en la dieta mediterr\u00e1nea fortalece su efecto protector, posicion\u00e1ndolo como un alimento clave en la promoci\u00f3n de la salud. Se recomienda su consumo diario en sustituci\u00f3n de grasas saturadas y procesadas para maximizar sus beneficios. La sal est\u00e1 involucrada en el control y en la intensidad de la hipertensi\u00f3n arterial, del da\u00f1o renal en forma de excreci\u00f3n urinaria de alb\u00famina alterada y de lesiones en otros \u00f3rganos diana, sobre todo en pacientes sensibles a la sal. El potasio produce descenso de la presi\u00f3n arterial a trav\u00e9s de su efecto vasodilatador y natriur\u00e9tico, lo que reduce eventos y mortalidad. El consumo de bebidas con contenido alcoh\u00f3lico en general es perjudicial para la salud, aunque s\u00ed se ha visto una cierta protecci\u00f3n del desarrollo de infarto agudo de miocardio asociado a consumos bajos y con un patr\u00f3n de ingesta en las comidas y a partir de la edad media de la vida. La recomendaci\u00f3n de abstinencia total es fundamental entre la poblaci\u00f3n juvenil. Entre los bebedores de m\u00e1s de 50 a\u00f1os su consumo deber\u00eda limitarse a una UBE al d\u00eda (10 g de alcohol) en las mujeres y hasta dos en los varones. El consumo moderado de caf\u00e9 (hasta 3-5 tazas al d\u00eda) es recomendable desde el punto de vista cardiovascular, pues ha mostrado efectos antioxidantes y antiinflamatorios, lo que se asocia con un menor riesgo de presentar arritmias y enfermedades cardiovasculares, incluyendo infarto de miocardio e ictus, respecto a no consumirlo. Para obtener este beneficio su consumo ha de ser por la ma\u00f1ana. El chocolate act\u00faa como antioxidante y antiinflamatorio, lo que produce mejor\u00eda en la funci\u00f3n endotelial, la presi\u00f3n arterial, el perfil lip\u00eddico y la funci\u00f3n plaquetaria. Consumido en exceso puede tener efectos negativos a varios niveles, como exceso de peso, efecto estimulante y consumo de az\u00facares a\u00f1adidos. Las dietas de tipo mediterr\u00e1neo, con sus variantes (DASH, atl\u00e1ntica y n\u00f3rdica), han demostrado beneficios cardiovasculares y abogan por un consumo moderado y equilibrado de alimentos y coinciden en favorecer el uso de alimentos frescos, de temporada y locales, evitando grasas saturadas, productos refinados y procesados y bebidas azucaradas. Las dietas vegetarianas o veganas y las de ayuno intermitente han demostrado beneficios cardiovasculares, pero pueden conducir a d\u00e9ficits de nutrientes o representar riesgos en el embarazo, en la lactancia, en el crecimiento o en pacientes con diabetes, por lo que deber\u00edan contar con el asesoramiento de profesionales. El ejercicio f\u00edsico conlleva enormes beneficios para la salud individual y colectiva. El ejercicio regular se asocia con menores tasas de enfermedad cardiovascular, de diabetes de tipo 2, de s\u00edndrome metab\u00f3lico, de algunos c\u00e1nceres, de depresi\u00f3n y de deterioro cognitivo. Deben alcanzarse o duplicarse las recomendaciones m\u00ednimas de ejercicio f\u00edsico (150 min/semana). Las relaciones sociales son determinantes claves de la salud. El individuo es un agente social capaz de modificar normas y comportamientos en su entorno. Resultan fundamentales el apoyo familiar y el de pareja y las interacciones interpersonales en el desarrollo de competencias emocionales, de resiliencia y de autocuidado. El descanso nocturno adecuado es fundamental para mantener una buena salud f\u00edsica y ps\u00edquica. La detecci\u00f3n precoz de los trastornos del sue\u00f1o y su tratamiento puede mejorar la calidad de vida del paciente y evitar enfermedades cardiovasculares, metab\u00f3licas, oncol\u00f3gicas y psiqui\u00e1tricas. Las conductas adictivas repercuten en la salud cardiovascular de quienes las padecen. La medicina de estilo de vida saludable es un instrumento primordial, no solo para tratar estas patolog\u00edas, sino para prevenirlas. La salud sexual y reproductiva est\u00e1 muy estrechamente vinculada al riesgo cardiovascular. La hipertensi\u00f3n, la diabetes, la obesidad, la dislipemia, el tabaquismo y el estr\u00e9s afectan negativamente tanto a la fertilidad como a la funci\u00f3n sexual, pero tambi\u00e9n la edad avanzada reduce la fertilidad, y la obesidad y el tabaco agravan los riesgos reproductivos y cardiovasculares. La terapia de fertilidad, en general, no ha demostrado incrementar el riesgo cardiovascular a largo plazo, aunque puede aumentar complicaciones a corto plazo. Algunos f\u00e1rmacos para enfermedades cardiovasculares pueden afectar tanto a la funci\u00f3n sexual como a la reproductiva. El estr\u00e9s cr\u00f3nico puede actuar como desencadenante y amplificador de procesos cardiovasculares subyacentes. Los efectos delet\u00e9reos del estr\u00e9s se potencian si coexisten con otros factores de riesgo, como sedentarismo, mala calidad del sue\u00f1o o aislamiento social. Conviene identificar si el estr\u00e9s proviene del \u00e1mbito laboral, familiar o econ\u00f3mico. Para controlarlo deben aplicarse t\u00e9cnicas de relajaci\u00f3n, debe promoverse la pr\u00e1ctica de ejercicio f\u00edsico estructurado, favorecerse el apoyo social, mantenerse una adecuada higiene del sue\u00f1o y deben establecerse l\u00edmites y priorizarse tareas. La contaminaci\u00f3n ambiental representa uno de los principales riesgos ambientales para la salud humana, con especial repercusi\u00f3n en el sistema cardiovascular. Los contaminantes atmosf\u00e9ricos incluyen part\u00edculas y gases que, en funci\u00f3n de su composici\u00f3n y tama\u00f1o, pueden penetrar profundamente en el organismo. Las part\u00edculas finas (PM2,5) y ultrafinas (PM0,1) son especialmente peligrosas por su capacidad para inducir inflamaci\u00f3n sist\u00e9mica, estr\u00e9s oxidativo y disfunci\u00f3n endotelial.", "journal": "Nutricion hospitalaria", "date": "2026-01-22", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9Abell\u00e1n Alem\u00e1n"], "doi": "10.20960/nh.06578"}
{"title": "Risk Factors and Outcomes of Immunoglobulin A Vasculitis in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and vice versa: A Systematic Review of the current literature.", "abstract": "This systematic review sought to thoroughly investigate the relationship between Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Immunoglobulin A Vasculitis (IgAV), pinpointing both factors that increase risk and those that provide protection, laying the groundwork for future studies on specific treatments approaches to enhance the wellbeing of patients with IgAV and / or IBD.\nThere is a new and quickly expanding body of literature on this subject, indicating a rising interest in it. Recent research has sought to investigate the connection between newly emerged viruses, such as COVID-19, or medications like Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (anti-TNF-\u03b1), and the development, progression, and treatment approaches of IgAV in IBD patients, and vice versa. Certain recent research is centered on a particular age groups or the condition of the initial illness. IgAV has been observed for numerous years following the diagnosis of IBD, displaying manifestations in the skin, joints, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. IBD encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and IgAV share immunological overlaps via dysregulated IgA production, genetic loci like HLA-DQA1/DQB1, and environmental triggers such as infections amid gut dysbiosis. IgAV often emerges as an IBD sequela or anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy complication, with TNF blockade potentially disrupting B-cell maturation, fostering Gd-IgA1 complexes, and neutrophil-driven inflammation. (31) studies encompassing (83) patients with co-occurring IBD and IgAV, predominantly males (60.2%) and younger individuals with confirmed dual diagnoses (95.2%). Compared to UC, more severe CD phenotypes and extended disease duration correlate with increased IgAV risk. Anti-TNF inhibitors appear to substantially contribute to IgAV onset in IBD patients. Most affected individuals develop IBD initially, followed by IgAV, whereas only a minority experience IBD subsequent to IgAV diagnosis. Ceasing anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy post-IgAV diagnosis may lead to IgAV resolution but could also trigger disease recurrence. The study's limited sample size has hindered the researchers from reaching conclusions via a meta-analysis. Additionally, the criteria utilized for IBD diagnosis have displayed inconsistency across all studies. Patients with IBD are at higher risk of developing IgAV, thus a high level of suspicion and prompt diagnostic assessment are crucial. To date, there have been no previous systematic reviews or meta-analyses highlighting a link between IgAV and IBD. Therefore, this systematic review is a pivotal endeavor to elucidate the complex relationship between these conditions, shaping future research in this area.", "journal": "Current gastroenterology reports", "date": "2026-01-22", "authors": ["Samer AAl-Shbailat", "ShahdAlqato", "Asem YAlkhalaileh", "RandSuleiman", "SadeenZein Eddin", "AlyamanKarajeh", "Raghad GAl-Shbeilat", "RamaHussein", "HamzehHatamleh", "Jaber HJaradat", "KhaledAlsagarat", "Laila KAsfour"], "doi": "10.1007/s11894-025-01027-w"}

The gut microbiome, composed primarily of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, immune balance, and neuroimmune signaling. Disruption of this microbial ecosystem is characterized by loss of beneficial short chain fatty acid producing bacteria and expansion of pathogenic species which promotes mucosal inflammation, cytokine release, and neuroimmune signaling that can disrupt mental health through the gut-brain axis. Emerging evidence links microbial metabolites, vagal tone, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in a feedback loop that perpetuates inflammation and alters mood regulation. Current therapeutic approaches include diet modification, osteopathic manipulative treatments, fecal microbiota transplantation and phage therapy.

Therapeutic drug monitoring has been used to optimise treatment with other biological agents; however, the clinical applicability of measuring vedolizumab trough concentrations is unclear. Initial registration trial data demonstrated a positive exposure-efficacy relationship of vedolizumab in IBD. However, there is conflicting data in more recent studies, with no definitive benefit of vedolizumab dose-escalation and no consistent target vedolizumab trough concentration identified. Also, unlike with anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, the clinical benefit of immunomodulator co-therapy with vedolizumab is uncertain.

Aberrant DNA methylation patterns, such as promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and global hypomethylation, contribute to genomic instability and altered gene expression. In parallel, inflammation-induced changes in histone configuration modulate chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activity of key oncogenic and tumor-suppressive pathways.

Baseline FC was strongly associated with patient-reported flares (FC \u2265250\u2009\u00b5g/g: adjusted HR (aHR) 2.22; FC 50-250\u2009\u00b5g/g: aHR 1.52 (reference <50\u2009\u00b5g/g)) and objective flares (FC \u2265250\u2009\u00b5g/g: aHR 3.25; FC 50-250\u2009\u00b5g/g: aHR 1.98). In UC, higher total meat intake was associated with increased risk of objective flares (highest versus lowest quartile: aHR 1.95, 95%\u2009CI 1.07 to 3.56). No consistent associations were observed for ultraprocessed foods, fibre or polyunsaturated fatty acids and flare.\nHigher habitual meat intake was associated with increased risk of objective flare in UC, suggesting diet may contribute to flare susceptibility in specific patient groups.\nNCT03282903.", "journal": "Gut", "date": "2026-01-20", "authors": ["NathanConstantine-Cooke", "BeatrizGros", "NikolasPlevris", "Linda JWilliams", "Gareth-RhysJones", "JanetKyle", "Nicholas AKennedy", "VictorVelasco-Pardo", "AlexanderRudge", "DebbieAlexander", "Carl AAnderson", "MaiaraBrusco de Freitas", "Lisa MDerr", "Lauranne AapDerikx", "SianGilchrist", "PaulHenderson", "Graham WHorgan", "PeterIrving", "Christopher ALamb", "LukeJostins-Dean", "James OLindsay", "JonathanMacDonald", "CraigMowat", "CharlesMurray", "MilesParkes", "Spyros ISiakavellas", "Catalina AVallejos", "Daniel RGaya", "Jonathan MRhodes", "Alexandra MJohnstone", "Christopher JWeir", "Charlie WLees", "NoneNone"], "doi": "10.1136/gutjnl-2025-337846"}
{"title": "Annexin A1 and A2 in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis: exploring new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.", "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a significant global health burden with gastrointestinal inflammation resulting from dysfunctional immune responses and chronic inflammation. This review synthesizes the roles of annexin A1 (AnxA1) and annexin A2 (AnxA2) in the pathophysiology of IBD, their diagnostic biomarkers, and therapeutic potential. AnxA1 interacts with FPR2/ALX receptors, inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting epithelial cell repair. AnxA2 exhibits dual roles by interacting with S100A10. AnxA2 can induce NF-\u03baB activation, promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine release and plasminogen activation. On the other hand, AnxA2 activates the TRAM-TRIF pathway, inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation, promoting production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, fibrinolysis, and restoring tight junctions. Their modulation of NF-\u03baB pathways shapes the molecular landscape of IBD. AnxA1 and AnxA2 are non-invasive plasma biomarkers that improve subtype-specific diagnostic accuracy compared to C-reactive protein. In the therapeutic context, AnxA1 mimetics and AnxA2 inhibitors reduce inflammation and promote healing, potentially in conjunction with anti-TNF drugs or nanoparticle delivery. Longitudinal studies and clinical trials are essential to identify the gaps in the standardization of testing and cytokine network interactions. AnxA1 and AnxA2 have the potential to transform the development of precise diagnostics and personalized therapies, redefining the management of IBD.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2026-01-19", "authors": ["Najib Muaamer FaedMurshed", "PraveenkumarShetty", "Pavan KJayaswamy", "Ankeeta MenonaJacob", "Samah Saleh AhmedAlawadhi", "Kishan PrasadHosapatna Laxminarayana"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2025.1725965"}
{"title": "Emu Oil: A Potential Adjunct to Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment?", "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic lifelong condition that affects the colon to a variable extent. Current treatments for IBD include aminosalicylate-based drugs, corticosteroids, antibiotics, immunomodulators, biologics, other small-molecule drugs, and surgical intervention. Nonetheless, treatment options are variably effective, associated with serious side effects, and often leave individuals at risk of relapse.\nIn this narrative review, we explore emu oil (EO), a naturally sourced agent, that may be utilised to broaden therapeutic options in IBD. The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, reparative, and protective properties of EO have been attributed to its unique blend of fatty acids and non-triglyceride fraction. To date, several preclinical trials of orally administered EO have demonstrated these properties in a range of intestinal inflammatory conditions, showing reduced inflammation and mucosal damage, together enhancing intestinal healing.\nWhile EO remains an interesting candidate for future investigations, current knowledge is limited to animal models and its clinical relevance is yet to be defined. Well-designed clinical trials will be essential to determine the safety and efficacy of EO before it can be considered as a potential adjunct to conventional therapy for IBD.", "journal": "Inflammatory intestinal diseases", "date": "2026-01-19", "authors": ["Sisanda NomceboMhlanga", "Gordon StanleyHowarth", "SuzanneMashtoub"], "doi": "10.1159/000549758"}
{"title": "Epstein-Barr virus infection increases the risk for inflammatory bowel disease.", "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) plays a role in the etiology of Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. We investigated whether a history of infectious mononucleosis, a well-known marker of early EBV exposure, is also associated with these diagnoses.\nIn case-control studies, we examined the concurrence of infectious mononucleosis, Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, SLE, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis in the same patients, using the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) electronic database. Patients diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis, Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis were identified by their corresponding International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. We compared the observed concurrence of each two diagnoses with their expected frequencies in the overall UPHS population by calculating odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.\nThe UPHS database from 2000 to 2024 contained a total of 3 955 827 unique patients. Among these individuals, 10 462 were diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis, 5552 with Hodgkin lymphoma, 16 777 with multiple sclerosis, 18 475 with Crohn's disease, and 22 830 with ulcerative colitis. A prior history of infectious mononucleosis carried a 1.8-7.1-fold increased risk for concurrent Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, SLE, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis. Moreover, anyone of the five diagnoses Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, SLE, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis was significantly associated with the concurrence of any other diagnosis from the same group.\nThe six diagnoses, infectious mononucleosis, Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, SLE, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis tended to cluster in the same patient population. These results support the hypothesis that these diagnoses share a common etiology, most likely related to EBV infection during early lifetime.", "journal": "European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology", "date": "2026-01-19", "authors": ["Anna MBuchner", "RuthKohen", "AmnonSonnenberg"], "doi": "10.1097/MEG.0000000000003109"}
