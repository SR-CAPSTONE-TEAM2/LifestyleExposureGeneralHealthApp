We aimed to investigate the association between antibody to adalimumab (ATA) and antibody to infliximab (ATI) levels and treatment failure in IBD. Methods: This single-center, retrospective cohort study included consecutive IBD patients with ADA evaluated with a drug-tolerant assay between September 2012 and February 2023. A time-to-event analysis was performed for treatment failure, defined as the need for drug discontinuation due to primary non-response, loss of response, a serious adverse event, or an IBD-related surgery. Patients were followed from first positive ADA until treatment failure or the end of the follow-up (May 2024). Results: The study population consisted of 134 patients with IBD [n = 58 (43%) on adalimumab; n = 86, (64%) with Crohn’s disease]. Multiple COX regression analysis identified higher ADA levels to be associated with treatment failure (HR: 1.034, 95%CI: 1.024–1.045, p &lt; 0.001). A ROC analysis identified an ATA and ATI level threshold of 5.2 U/mL (AUC: 0.705; 95%CI: 0.569–0.841; p = 0.003; sensitivity: 64%; specificity: 82%) and 8.8 U/mL (AUC: 0.809; 95%CI: 0.713–0.906; p &lt; 0.001; sensitivity: 69%; specificity: 93%), respectively, to distinguish patients with or without treatment failure. Conclusions: In this large retrospective cohort study, higher levels of ADA were associated with treatment failure to anti-TNF therapy in IBD. Moreover, we identified ATA and ATI level thresholds of 5.2 U/mL and 8.8 U/mL, respectively, to be associated with treatment failure.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1899</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1915</offset><text>Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies, such as infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADM), are foundational in managing moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn’s disease (CD). However, their effectiveness is not universal. Up to 30% of patients do not respond and are considered as primary non-responders, while up to 50% after an initial response lose response over time. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has revealed that a key contributor to these unfavorable outcomes is immunogenicity, defined as the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2518</offset><text>Immunogenicity is a major challenge of anti-TNF therapies leading to increased drug clearance and undetectable or low drug concentrations. This is reflected by worse clinical outcomes including drug discontinuation and increased risk of infusion reactions. One meta-analysis of 68 studies showed that antibodies to infliximab (ATI) are associated with lower clinical response rates and higher rates of infusion reactions. Moreover, current data suggest that higher ADA are associated with worse outcomes. For example, a retrospective cohort study demonstrated that patients with ATI levels higher than 8.8 U/mL had greater drug discontinuation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3163</offset><text>However, there is misperception regarding the cut-offs utilized for the definition of high vs. low ADA levels and the thresholds associated with negative clinical outcomes in IBD. Additionally, various assays use different units to measure ADA, such as μg/mL, ng/mL or U/mL (i.e., the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay vs. the homogeneous mobility shift assay (HMSA)). Another confounding factor is whether the TDM assay is drug-sensitive or drug-tolerant. Drug-sensitive assays can measure ADA only when drug concentrations are undetectable, while drug-tolerant assays can measure ADA even in the presence of drug concentrations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3795</offset><text>Preliminary data regarding the widely used drug-tolerant HMSA suggest that ATI levels higher than a threshold of 8.5 to 10.0 U/mL are associated with worse outcomes and are difficult to overcome, while the cut-off for antibodies to adalimumab (ATA) associated with negative outcomes remains largely unknown. Other knowledge gaps regarding the impact of ADA on the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy include the presence or absence of drug concentrations and the role of reactive compared to proactive TDM when first detecting ADA.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4320</offset><text>This study aimed to investigate the association of ADA levels with treatment failure and to identify ATA or ATI level thresholds distinguishing patients with or without treatment failure.

Both proactive and reactive TDM were performed with the aim of achieving and maintaining drug concentrations typically higher than 5–10 μg/mL for infliximab and 10–15 μg/m for adalimumab. Serum adalimumab and infliximab concentration as well as ATA and ATI were measured using the homogeneous mobility shift assay (HMSA) (Prometheus Laboratories Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for infliximab concentration was 1 μg/mL, while the LLOQ for ATI was 3.1 U/mL. The LLOQ for adalimumab concentration was 1.6 μg/mL, while the LLOQ for ATA was 1.7 U/mL. The upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) for infliximab concentration was 34 μg/mL, while the ULOQ for ATI was 100 U/mL. The ULOQ for adalimumab concentration was 50 μg/mL, while the ULOQ for ATA was 55 U/mL. Anti-drug antibody levels and drug concentrations &lt; LLOQ were treated as “0,” whereas values higher than the ULOQ were treated as ULOQ + 1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6850</offset><text>2.3.

Furthermore, our study identified a cut-off of 5.2 U/mL for ATA that distinguished patients with or without treatment failure. This is the first to identify an ATA level associated with clinical outcomes. We also identified a cut-off of 8.8 U/mL for ATI that distinguished patients with or without treatment failure. This ATI threshold is similar to one reported in a previous study, which demonstrated that in patients with loss of response to infliximab and ATI &lt; 9.1 U/mL, dose optimization is a valid therapeutic option. Moreover, a study by Battat and colleagues, including patients with IBD and immunogenicity to infliximab, showed that dose escalation eliminated an initial ATI level of ≤ 8.6 U/mL with increased efficacy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13485</offset><text>We also demonstrated that immunogenicity to anti-TNF therapy leads to treatment failure regardless of whether the drug is detectable when ADA are identified or whether the drug is adalimumab or infliximab. This is in line with a previous study showing that ATI can negatively influence the efficacy of infliximab even in low concentrations and in the presence of an adequate trough drug concentration. Our study is also the first to show that reactive, compared to proactive, TDM is independently associated with higher treatment failure in patients with ADA. This was previously shown for both infliximab and adalimumab in a larger population of patients with IBD, not all with ADA. It seems that reactive TDM is likely implemented too late in many patients, as high level ADA may have already developed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14291</offset><text>Strengths of this study include the rather large sample size for such a unique population, the representation of real-life clinical practice, and the utilization of a drug-tolerant assay that can allow the detection of ADA even in the presence of drug concentration. However, this study is limited by its retrospective design with an inherent potential for selection bias and the fact that causality cannot be established. Moreover, due to the retrospective design of the study, it was not feasible to control/account for the type of treatment modifications used to overcome immunogenicity, which are often heterogeneous. Additionally, the results may not be generalizable, as they represent clinical practice in a single large academic medical center. We would also like to highlight that the results of this study apply to patients who develop ADA rather than to all patients initiating anti-TNF therapy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15198</offset><text>In conclusion, this large retrospective cohort study showed that most patients with immunogenicity to anti-TNF therapy experience treatment failure, particularly those with higher levels of ADA identified by reactive TDM.
