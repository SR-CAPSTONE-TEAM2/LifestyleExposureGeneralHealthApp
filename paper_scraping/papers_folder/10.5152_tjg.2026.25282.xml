In CD, inflammation can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus, often appearing in discontinuous segments of the small and large intestines. In contrast, UC primarily impacts the colon, with inflammation occurring continuously in the distal regions of the bowel. Despite advancements in treatment, IBD remains a significant global health challenge, having a profound impact on patients’ quality of life, and its prevalence is notably rising in industrialized countries. Recent studies have identified genetic and environmental factors, such as lifestyle, diet, antibiotic use, and smoking, as significant contributors to the development of IBD. Furthermore, other autoimmune diseases may coexist with IBD, potentially increasing the risk of its occurrence.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3582</offset><text>Autoimmune skin diseases, particularly vitiligo, are among the common disorders that not only affect skin health but can also be associated with other systemic conditions. Vitiligo is a chronic disease characterized by the loss of skin pigmentation, manifesting in specific areas due to an immune system attack on melanocytes. This condition primarily presents as white patches without other symptoms such as itching or pain, and it can occur on any part of the skin, especially in areas exposed to sunlight, such as the face and hands. Vitiligo has a global prevalence of 0.5%-2% and can affect individuals of all ages and ethnic backgrounds, though it is more commonly observed in young people and during adolescence. While vitiligo is largely considered a cosmetic concern, growing evidence suggests that this disorder may be linked to other autoimmune diseases, including IBD, indicating its potential association with internal systemic conditions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4535</offset><text>Recent epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests a significant association between vitiligo and the onset of IBD. This association is likely reflective of shared immunogenetic factors and systemic chronic inflammation. In a large population study conducted in South Korea, the risk of developing CD and UC in individuals with vitiligo was found to be 2.14 and 1.89 times higher, respectively, compared to the general population. Additionally, a recent study by Schonmann et al  showed that less than 0.5% of vitiligo patients were diagnosed with UC or CD, yet the prevalence of IBD was higher in comparison to those without vitiligo. Collectively, these findings emphasize the need for targeted and more in-depth exploration of this clinical association.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5295</offset><text>Given the scattered evidence regarding the connection between vitiligo and IBD, conducting a systematic review aimed at more accurately assessing the prevalence of IBD in these patients could fill the existing gap in the literature. Therefore, the authors set out to explore the prevalence of IBD in individuals with vitiligo through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This study, by synthesizing and analyzing these structured pieces of evidence, will enable the identification of epidemiological patterns and could provide a foundation for the development of targeted screening.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5880</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>5902</offset><text>Study Design</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5915</offset><text>The present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis.

One of the studies was conducted jointly across 3 countries: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, while the remaining studies were carried out in 4 regions: the Eastern Mediterranean Region (2 studies), the European Region (4 studies), the Region of the Americas (7 studies), and the Western Pacific Region (2 studies). All studies involved both genders, with the average age ranging from 24.5 to 52.3 years in the studies that reported this information. Among these, 1 study specifically reported the prevalence of UC, and another focused solely on the prevalence of CD. The quality assessment results of the articles, based on the corresponding checklist, revealed that 9 studies had a low risk of bias, 6 studies had a moderate risk of bias, and 1 study had a high risk of bias.

The analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity across studies for IBD (Q = 2650.39, I2 = 98.89%). In addition, a funnel plot was conducted to assess publication bias in studies on the prevalence of IBD.

Additionally, the highest pooled prevalence of IBD was reported by Saudi Arabia with a single record, at 1.72% (0.36-3.08). Further subgroup analysis based on study design showed that retrospective cohort studies reported a slightly higher pooled prevalence (1.03%; 95% CI: 0.69-1.37) compared to cross-sectional studies (0.86%; 95% CI: 0.24-1.48). Similarly, studies using clinical examination as the diagnostic method reported consistent estimates (0.97%; 95% CI: 0.67-1.27), while questionnaire-based studies showed wider uncertainty (0.98%; 95% CI: 0.05-1.91) (Table 3). The results (based on 3 records) also showed that the pooled prevalence of IBD was higher in women with vitiligo (0.71%, 95% CI: 0.34-1.09) compared to men (0.66%, 95% CI: 0.51-0.81) (Figure 4).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14084</offset><text>Risk Factor Evaluation</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14107</offset><text>In the analysis of vitiligo as a risk factor for the development of IBD and its subtypes, it was found that among the 6 studies examining vitiligo as a risk factor for IBD, vitiligo was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of developing IBD (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10-2.07). Furthermore, among 5 studies focused on CD, it was shown that vitiligo significantly increases the prevalence of CD (OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.13-1.97).

Additionally, when examining studies by data entry years, the pooled prevalence of IBD also shows a nonsignificant increase as the years progress from 2000 to 2020 (Reg Coef = 0.029, 95% CI: −0.02 to 0.80, P = .257). Furthermore, when considering the studies based on the average age of patients, it was found that as the average age increases from 24 years to 51 years, the pooled prevalence of IBD rises, though this increase is not statistically significant (Reg Coef = 0.047, 95% CI: −0.01 to 0.91, P = .06). Lastly, when analyzing studies based on Human Development Index (HDI), no significant change was observed in the pooled prevalence of IBD as the HDI level increased (Reg Coef = −0.106, 95% CI: −6.30 to 6.09, P = .971) (Figure 6).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>15784</offset><text>Sensitivity Analysis</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15805</offset><text>The sensitivity analysis results indicated that excluding any individual study did not cause a significant change in the effect size, and the findings remained statistically significant (Supplementary Figure 2).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>16017</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16028</offset><text>Our study found that the prevalence of IBD in patients with vitiligo was approximately 1%, with slightly lower rates observed for specific subtypes such as UC and CD. Furthermore, the prevalence of IBD in countries such as the United States (from the Region of the Americas) and Israel (from the European Region), where more than 1 record was available, was close to 1%. These findings align with the results of similar studies. For example, a study by Alkhateeb et al in high-income countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada) found that the prevalence of IBD among 2078 patients with vitiligo was 0.67%. Another study by Gill et al in the United States reported a prevalence of 0.73% in vitiligo patients. Similarly, a study by Eleftheriadou et al in the UK also showed that the prevalence of IBD in patients with vitiligo was less than 1%. Additionally, a study by Ezzedine et al in the US and Kridin et al in Israel confirmed that the prevalence of IBD in vitiligo patients was under 1% (24, 27). However, a study by Ramot et al in Israel, involving 11 412 vitiligo patients, reported a prevalence of 1.81%. Other studies, such as those by Sheth et al in the US and Tharwat et al in Egypt, reported prevalences of IBD greater than 1%. Overall, various studies generally agree that the prevalence of IBD in patients with vitiligo is typically around 1%, though some studies report higher or lower rates. This variability can be attributed to multiple factors, including geographic differences and healthcare access. For instance, the studies conducted in regions with better healthcare access (e.g., the US, UK, and Israel) may be more likely to diagnose IBD in early or milder cases, leading to higher reported prevalence rates. In contrast, regions with limited healthcare access may underreport cases, resulting in lower estimates. Additionally, methodological differences, such as the use of clinical examination vs. questionnaire-based diagnoses, may introduce variability in prevalence measurements. Also, an analysis of study risk of bias revealed that studies with low risk of bias tended to report slightly lower prevalence rates, whereas studies with higher risk of bias reported higher prevalence estimates. This pattern suggests that methodological quality plays a crucial role in the findings, and caution should be exercised when interpreting the data from studies with higher bias risk. However, it is important to note that the prevalence findings for certain countries, such as Saudi Arabia, are based on very limited data, with the highest prevalence reported from a single record. Furthermore, the geographic distribution of the studies included in this analysis poses limitations in generalizing the findings across different populations. Future research should aim to address these gaps by incorporating more data from diverse geographic regions and considering additional factors that may contribute to the observed associations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19001</offset><text>Various studies generally indicate that the prevalence of IBD in patients with vitiligo is typically less than 1%, particularly for the CD subtype, which has consistently been reported as less than 1% in nearly all studies. Regarding UC, except for 3 studies that reported a prevalence greater than 1%, most studies have shown that the prevalence of UC in vitiligo patients is generally less than 1%. For example, a study by Schneeweiss et al reported a prevalence of only 0.17% for UC among vitiligo patients. However, this study revealed that the prevalence of UC in vitiligo patients was slightly higher than that of CD. This difference may be attributed to the pathophysiological distinctions between UC and CD; while UC is primarily confined to the colon, CD can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, various hypotheses, including genetic, immune, and environmental factors, may contribute to the increased prevalence of UC in patients with vitiligo. Overall, these findings are likely due to pathological similarities between these diseases, resulting from comparable immune dysfunctions. Therefore, based on the existing research, UC is generally observed in less than 1% of vitiligo patients, but the reported differences may be due to factors such as research methodologies and target populations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20331</offset><text>The results of this study showed that the prevalence of IBD based on gender was slightly higher in women than in men. Specifically, a study by Alkhateeb et al found that 0.73% of the female vitiligo population developed IBD, compared to 0.52% of the male population. Additionally, in a study by Hadi et al, women had double the prevalence of men. However, in a study by Kridin et al, focusing on one of the IBD subtypes, men had a higher prevalence of 0.67%, compared to 0.50% in women. These differences in IBD prevalence between genders may be attributed to several factors, including hormonal and immune system differences. Numerous studies have shown that hormonal factors, particularly estrogen, can play a significant role in the development of autoimmune diseases and may especially increase inflammatory responses in women. Moreover, some studies suggest that due to differences in healthcare access and disease diagnosis, women in certain populations may be more likely to receive an IBD diagnosis, potentially contributing to the higher prevalence in females. Consequently, based on these findings and existing research, it appears that the prevalence of IBD may be higher in women than in men in certain cases, which could be related to genetic, hormonal, and social differences. However, it is important to note that the results related to gender should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on only 3 studies. The sample sizes in these studies were relatively small, and more comprehensive research is needed to confirm the observed trends and clarify the underlying factors contributing to gender differences in IBD prevalence.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21982</offset><text>Ultimately, this study demonstrated that vitiligo may significantly increase the risk of developing IBD and its subtypes, particularly UC, by approximately 1.5 times. Although these findings suggest an increased likelihood of UC in patients with vitiligo, the observed relationship was not statistically significant. These results are consistent with the findings of several previous studies. For instance, a study by Ezzedine et al reported that 0.7% of patients with vitiligo developed IBD compared to 0.5% in the control group, and this study found a significant association between vitiligo and the prevalence of IBD and its subtypes. Similarly, a study by Kang et al showed that IBD subtypes were significantly associated with an increased risk of CD (16%) and UC (21%). However, in this study, UC was specifically associated with a higher prevalence in patients with vitiligo, though this association was not statistically robust. These findings may be attributed to genetic, immune, and environmental differences that contribute to the development of these diseases. Notably, some studies have suggested that vitiligo, as an autoimmune disease, could predispose individuals to IBDs such as IBD. In this context, shared genetic factors and similar immune responses may play a critical role in the development of both diseases. These pathophysiological overlaps could explain the increased risk of IBD in patients with vitiligo. Furthermore, hormonal, genetic, and environmental differences may also influence the co-occurrence of these diseases in vitiligo patients. </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23556</offset><text>When interpreting the results of this study, it is important to consider its limitations. The first limitation is the limited number of studies that have specifically examined the prevalence of IBD in patients with vitiligo. This scarcity of studies may affect the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, it is important to interpret the pooled prevalence estimate with caution due to the substantial heterogeneity observed across studies. This variability reflects differences in study design, sample size, geographic region, and diagnostic methods. While subgroup and sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the overall findings, the summary estimate should not be viewed as universally generalizable but rather as a descriptive aggregation of heterogeneous data. Moreover, the inconsistency in the diagnostic status of patients is another limitation, as some studies assessed the status of vitiligo patients using questionnaires and self-reporting, which may not provide accurate enough data and could lead to incomplete or imprecise information for the researchers. Another important limitation is the possibility of publication bias. Studies that found low or nonsignificant associations between vitiligo and IBD may be less likely to have been published, leading to their exclusion from the evidence base. This phenomenon, known as selective publication, can artificially inflate the pooled prevalence estimate by over-representing studies with stronger or statistically significant results. The asymmetry observed in the funnel plot (Supplementary Figure 1) supports this concern, indicating that the true prevalence may be lower than the pooled estimate suggests. Readers should interpret the summary findings with this potential distortion in mind. Another limitation of this meta-analysis is the lack of information on potential confounders such as smoking status, biologic therapy, vitiligo severity, and healthcare utilization in many of the included datasets. These factors could contribute to part of the observed association between vitiligo and IBD. The absence of such data means that the potential influence of these variables on the findings could not be assessed in the analysis. Future studies should aim to account for these confounders to better clarify the nature of the association. Finally, the lack of detailed baseline information, such as the stage of vitiligo, its distribution, and treatment regimen, could serve as a confounding factor in the study results, as this information may significantly impact the interpretation and analysis of the data.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26151</offset><text>This study found that the co-occurrence of IBD in patients with vitiligo is approximately 0.97%. Furthermore, no significant differences in the prevalence of IBD and its subtypes (CD and UC) were observed across various studies and geographic regions. The research also revealed that vitiligo significantly increases the risk of developing IBD and its subtypes. Healthcare providers, particularly gastroenterologists and dermatologists, should be aware of this association and consider IBD as a differential diagnosis in vitiligo patients who present with gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, preventing and early identification of IBD risk factors in these patients is crucial. Healthcare systems should focus on educating vitiligo patients about the importance of regular check-ups to ensure any underlying risk factors for IBD are promptly identified and managed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>27022</offset><text>Supplementary Materials</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>27046</offset><text>Peer-review: Externally peer-reviewed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>27085</offset><text>Author Contributions: Concept – Z.G., J.T.; Design – Z.G., J.T.; Supervision – Z.G., J.T.; Resources – Z.G., J.T.; Materials – Z.G., J.T.; Data Collection and/or Processing – Z.G., J.T.; Analysis and/or Interpretation – Z.G., J.T.; Literature Search – Z.G., J.T.; Writing Manuscript – Z.G., J.T.; Critical Review – Z.G., J.T.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>27431</offset><text>Acknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Xianyang Central Hospital and Yantai Qishan Hospital for their support during the preparation of this manuscript.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>27594</offset><text>Declaration of Interests: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>27674</offset><text>Data Availability Statement:</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27703</offset><text>The study included all data in the main manuscript and supplementary files.
