Annual screening for LTB was found to be grossly neglected at 27%. Incidence of LTB was 10.7% and active tuberculosis (TB) developed in 4.5% of the patients on advanced therapy. Other interesting finding was occurrence of active TB with any advanced therapy, suggesting that there is no ‘safe’ therapy in TB endemic regions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2758</offset><text>INTRODUCTION</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2771</offset><text>Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are chronic immune-mediated inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may require immunosuppression with biologics and/or small molecule inhibitors for sustained remission. Shifting targets in IBD, expanding armamentarium and increasing availability of these drugs have increased the usage of such advanced therapy. Risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB) on anti-tumor necrosis factors (anti-TNFs) is reported to vary depending on the type of advanced therapy, TB endemicity, stringency of LTB screening and prophylactic treatment. Latent TB (LTB) screening is one of the proposed actions to reduce the risk of TB reactivation before advanced therapy. Screening for LTB is recognised to be porous, with many cases slipping through a rather imperfect screening tool.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3589</offset><text>Lack of adequate LTB screening is a strong predictor for the development of active TB. Most guidelines recommend systematic screening for the presence of LTB or active TB before starting biologics and small-molecule inhibitors. Systematic screening involves utilising the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) or both. Additionally, a chest X-ray (CXR) is advised to rule out active TB. These methods or combinations thereof for screening are believed to be inadequate in detecting subclinical TB. Previous studies have shown that most patients who develop TB are negative for LTB screening. LTB screening with CT chest in TB endemic regions was initially suggested for patients on anti-TNF for rheumatological diseases. However, a gap remains between guidelines and real-world experience in LTB screening. We aimed to study the practices of screening for LTB and study the incidence, as well as the pattern of TB in patients with IBD on biologicals and small molecule inhibitors in a TB endemic region. Previous studies from this region have been single center and included only anti-TNF. This study included a multicentric data, with large sample size and inclusion of both biologics and small molecules.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4826</offset><text>MATERIALS AND METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4848</offset><text>Study design</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4861</offset><text>This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained databases at 17 centers across India.

Information on LTB infection screening methodology/tests utilised before initiating advanced therapy were recorded, including past history of TB, past antitubercular therapy (ATT), CXR, TST, IGRA, and computed tomography (CT) chest. Annual screening practices on patients with biologic/small molecule therapy for more than 1 year were also recorded. Results of the LTB screen, development of active TB on follow-up, and the interval between advanced therapy and development of TB were noted. A history of recent contact with active TB (someone in the family or close contact diagnosed and treated as TB) was actively sought for. If a patient had LTB, details of any therapy received, delay in onset of therapy and modification of biologic/small molecule therapy were recorded. Relevant information on the type of advanced therapy (anti-TNF agents, anti-integrin, Janus kinase inhibitor) and agents used in addition to the advanced therapy (steroids, thiopurines or methotrexate) was also noted. The principal investigators (Jha DK and Sharma V) regularly reviewed the data for completeness, and any missing information was retrieved telephonically from the centers and updated in the data records. Any discrepancies in data were rechecked and confirmed before analysis. Only records with complete information were included.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7527</offset><text>Outcomes assessed</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7545</offset><text>We checked for compliance with LTB screening before starting biological therapy or small molecule inhibitors in patients with IBD.

We checked for the strategy used for LTB screening, as mentioned in the definitions below and the impact of using (or not using) a particular strategy. The positivity of LTB, as well as therapies administered (or not) for LTBI prior to starting advanced therapy, was noted. We also studied the frequency, as well as the pattern of TB, while the patient was on advanced therapy.

Progression to active TB was noted among 2 of 15 (13.3%) untreated LTB patients and 3 of 25 (12.0%) who received prophylaxis for LTB. Seventeen patients (4.49%) developed active TB on advanced therapy and most of them had pulmonary TB (9/17, 52.94%). Among active TB patients most were either on combined immunosuppression or steroids (16/317, 5.0% vs 1/61, 1.6%, P = 0.33). Among active TB patients, most were on anti-TNF biologicals 15/17 (88.23%).

Among 2 patients who continued advanced therapy, one on tofacitinib underwent de-escalation of dose and one on vedolizumab continued the therapy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>24095</offset><text>DISCUSSION</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24106</offset><text>This multicenter retrospective study evaluating the LTB screening practices before advanced therapy use in a TB endemic region suggests suboptimal compliance with the LTB screening guidelines. Standard screening, CT-based screening and annual screening for LTB was found grossly neglected, compliance being only 59%, 64% and 27%, respectively. Incidence of LTB was 10.7% and active TB developed in 4.5% of the patients on advanced therapy. Our study had a lower reactivation of TB compared to previous reports, which may be related to decreasing TB incidence. Also, patients affording such treatment may not represent patients with typical risk factors for TB. Active TB developed primarily in patients on anti-TNF (4.85%, 15/309), with a case each with anti-integrin (3.57%, 1/28) and Janus kinase inhibitor (2.43%, 1/41). The presence of LTB showed significance with the development of active TB (P = 0.033). Type of advanced therapy and type of IBD showed no significant association with the development of active TB, although active TB was numerically higher in the anti-TNF group. The study has some interesting findings apart from the low compliance with TB screening guidelines. It shows a lower incidence of active TB on advanced therapy in India compared to the past and active TB can occur with any advanced therapy, suggesting that there is no ‘safe’ therapy in TB endemic regions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25503</offset><text>TB is a dynamic infection with risk of reactivation on immunosuppression or de-novo infection due to re-exposure. Screening before advanced therapy is intended to identify those at risk of reactivation i.e., having LTB. Limited data shows up to 20% of the patients on anti-TNF with negative LTB screening at baseline have conversion to positive test on annual screening and European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization suggests annual screening in TB endemic regions. This study showed development of active TB was numerically higher in patients on anti-TNF compared to tofacitinib or vedolizumab but was not found significant (P = 0.759). Active TB was noted to be significantly higher among patients with LTB (P = 0.033). This data emphasises the role of adherence to LTB screening guidelines irrespective of the type of advanced therapy. However, our study noted suboptimal adherence to the LTB screening recommendation. Only a quarter (27.17%) of patients on advanced therapy for more than 1 year (48.67%) underwent annual screening. LTB screening compliance was higher with IGRA (79% vs 69%) as compared to TST, which may be explained by the ease of performing and avoidance of additional visit. Screening with CXR should be done in all, but was done in only 79% of patients. Diagnostic limitation of CXR have led to increasing utilisation of CT chest in LTB screening and has been suggested to reduce reactivation. Our study showed compliance with CT in only 64% of patients. Radiation exposure, practicality and cost-effectiveness related to CT screening has been poorly studied. Low dose CT has been advocated to reduce radiation exposure but lacks standardisation, limiting applicability. Although, stringent screening (inclusive of CT chest) has been recommended on the basis of a recent study showing a reduction in reactivation of TB from 17% to 1.7%. A close reading of the above study shows that probably use of CT chest was not a determinant in reducing the TB rates- the CT was performed in 83% of the non-stringent group also. On the other hand, it is the increase in treatment of LTB (after detecting it) which might be responsible for the difference, from 45% to 88%. Even in the present study, a significant number of patients did not receive LTB prophylaxis. Although concerning, it is unclear why clinicians might not treat LTB after detecting it. Importantly 17 patients who developed active TB, 3 patients had received LTB prophylaxis before initiation of advanced therapy. This may be explained by either drug resistance, reinfection, or drug noncompliance.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28085</offset><text>A retrospective Spanish study analysed 50 patients who developed active TB on anti-TNF and noted 40% of them had failed compliance with national TB screening guidelines. An early survey in France (2009) among gastroenterologists revealed only a quarter of them ordered TB screening prior to anti-TNF. Data from the Netherlands among 611 CD patients between 2000-2010 receiving anti-TNF, revealed variable compliance with LTB screening (TST: 57%, IGRA: 17% and CXR: 63%, while only 2% had all three tests). Similarly, ten years of veteran data that included 3357 IBD patients till 2011, noted compliance with TST or IGRA in around 70% but CXR in only 38% (only 1% of them underwent testing with both TST and IGRA). Our data shows a low compliance in a TB endemic region that is almost similar to the Western data. Compliance to screening may be varied due to academic affiliation of hospitals, rural urban divide, frequency of hospital visits and number of comorbidities. However, if we were to measure LTB screening practices as per time frame, it should have improved with increasing availability, larger evidence and clearer guidelines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29224</offset><text>To the best of our knowledge this study is the first multicentre audit of LTB screening practices among IBD patients in high-endemic regions, increasing its generalizability. Limitations of the study include retrospective design, potential recall bias, missing data, and lack of microbiological confirmation in some TB cases. Because this was not a prospectively planned study, it best collects real-world evidence providing information about the current practices in India. However, although audits are typically retrospective, this comes at the cost of many details that can be better evaluated in a prospective design. A complete battery of tests for LTB may not be utilised by all clinicians as one of the initial immunological tests or easily available tests for LTB may have turned positive. Impact of LTB prophylactic treatment on active TB may not be reflective of actual benefit due to small numbers. More importantly, the patients receiving advanced therapy by virtue of better socio-economic status may not truly represent the patients with heightened TB risk e.g., those from lower socioeconomic status and living in overcrowded conditions or suffering from undernutrition.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>30410</offset><text>CONCLUSION</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30421</offset><text>The current study provides concerning data regarding the lack of optimal screening prior to initiation of advanced therapy. We also provide data to support LTB screening irrespective of the advanced therapy used in TB endemic regions. Future studies may focus on compliance with LTB prophylactic therapy among IBD patients with LTB and its effect on active TB outcome. LTB screening adherence may be improved by collaborative effort of institutional and pharmacological industry.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon
