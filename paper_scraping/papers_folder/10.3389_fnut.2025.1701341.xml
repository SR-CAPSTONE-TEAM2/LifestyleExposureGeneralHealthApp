The disorder is linked to gut dysbiosis, and manipulation of the microbiota is considered a possible treatment strategy. This randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study aimed to investigate the effects of the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium breve, Bif195™ (DSM 33360) (Bif195), on symptoms and gut microbiome composition in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Sixty-one patients with moderate–severe disease activity were allocated to 8 weeks of treatment with either Bif195 or placebo (1:1), followed by 8 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcome was a change in symptom scores measured by the validated questionnaire, IBS-symptom severity scale. Secondary and explorative outcomes were the effects of Bif195 on intestinal symptoms, quality of life, fatigue, and the gut microbiota. Modulation of the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Caco-2 cells by Bif195 was investigated in vitro as a model of barrier integrity. The results showed no effect of Bif195 on primary or secondary outcomes; however, Bif195 lowered fatigue scores compared to placebo. Significantly increased TEER readings in vitro indicated enhanced barrier integrity, suggesting GI permeability as a mechanism for further clinical exploration.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1622</offset><text>Clinical trial registration</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1650</offset><text>, identifier NCT04808271.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1676</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1689</offset><text>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal (GI) disorders worldwide, estimated to affect 3.8% of the population (with the Rome IV criteria), with large geographical variations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1897</offset><text>The diagnosis is made when the IBS symptomatic criteria are met.

The IBS–SSS score and the IBS–QoL score were used to evaluate the effects of Bif195, together with other independent symptomatic outcomes, which made it possible to address a broad range of frequent somatic and mental health-related issues. However, no effects of Bif195 on the primary or secondary outcomes were found. Among the three explorative outcomes, we observed one statistically significant effect of Bif195: a positive effect on fatigue scores.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32722</offset><text>It has previously been hypothesised that increased gut permeability may be one of the key reasons for fatigue development in patients with IBS, possibly due to gut–brain axis involvement facilitated by neurohumoral communication between the brain and GI tract. For the disorders fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, growing evidence suggests an association between increased gut permeability and fatigue due to dysfunction of the intestinal mucosal barrier and the cascade of immune responses caused thereby. Based on the impact on fatigue in the current study, we conducted an experiment where the influence of Bif195 on epithelial integrity was explored in a well-established Caco-2 cell model. Bif195 significantly increased TEER over time, which could suggest that supplementation with Bif195 positively affects the permeability of the intestine. The species B. breve is acknowledged to produce metabolites, such as acetate, and aromatic amino acids involved in the maturation and strengthening of the epithelial barrier. Further, in previous studies, a highly conserved gene locus encoding a Type IVb tight adherence E (TadE) pili, acknowledged to accelerate epithelial cell proliferation, was identified in B. breve strains, which could also play a key role in improving barrier integrity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34052</offset><text>The effect of Bif195 on intestinal permeability has already been investigated in a healthy population via an exercise-induced permeability model without significant outcomes, most likely due to the rapid spontaneous recovery of the intestinal barrier in these healthy subjects following strenuous exercise. Nevertheless, investigation of barrier integrity in a population with IBS-D could potentially provide different results due to differences in the gut microbiota and underlying inflammatory conditions. For future perspectives, the association described in the literature between increased gut permeability and fatigue adds to the relevance of further investigations into the effect of Bif195 on gut permeability in a population with IBS-D.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34798</offset><text>We measured fatigue using the 11-point NRS and found a mean change in fatigue scores in the Bif195 group at −0.9 (range −4.7 to 2.9) from baseline to the end of intervention. Even though this was a statistically significant score reduction compared to the placebo group, we observed no overall improvement in quality of life among participants consuming Bif195 compared to placebo. This could be due to the low weight of fatigue-related questions within the IBS-QoL. Of a total of 34 questions, only 3 can be interpreted as fatigue-related: “Q18. I feel I get less done because of my bowel problems,” “Q22. I have to avoid strenuous activity because of my bowel problems,” and “Q25. I feel sluggish because of my bowel problems”. For two of these items, Q18 and Q22, it is debatable whether they are solely fatigue-related or if the level of agreement, stated by study participants, also depends on other factors such as abdominal pain, frequent toilet visits, or urgency. Fatigue was an exploratory endpoint and therefore not adjusted for multiple testing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35872</offset><text>Another explorative outcome of this study was gut microbiome analyses. In the Bif195 group, richness and beta diversity of the gut microbiome, and the relative abundance of B. breve were significantly different after 8 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. However, the differential abundance analysis of the Bif195 group showed that the treatment did not result in engraftment of the probiotic strain in the gut microbiota of the host. Thus, after termination of the treatment, the relative abundance of B. breve returned to baseline levels, correlating with fatigue scores that did not differ significantly between baseline and the follow-up visit.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36528</offset><text>Ongoing discussions debate the dose and duration of a probiotic treatment to successfully affect the outcomes of clinical studies.
