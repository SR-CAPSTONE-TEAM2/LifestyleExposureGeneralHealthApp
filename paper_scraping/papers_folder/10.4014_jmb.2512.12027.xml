Probiotics and postbiotics have been proposed as dietary interventions for intestinal health; however, their comparative preventive effects remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the preventive effects of probiotic and postbiotic forms of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei HY2782 in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Male C57BL/6 mice were orally administered live or heat-killed HY2782 prior to DSS exposure. Disease activity index, colon length, histopathological damage, inflammatory cytokine expression, and intestinal barrier-related gene expression were assessed, and gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Both probiotic and postbiotic forms of HY2782 significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis, as evidenced by reduced disease activity, preserved colon length, improved histological features, and suppressed expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, HY2782 treatment restored the expression of tight junction-related genes in colonic tissue. Gut microbiota analysis revealed limited but specific compositional changes following HY2782 administration, with no marked differences between live and heat-killed forms. These findings demonstrate that both probiotic and postbiotic forms of HY2782 exert preventive effects against DSS-induced colitis with no statistically significant differences between the two preparations. This suggests that HY2782 has significant potential as a versatile functional ingredient in both live and inactivated forms for the prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases, although further studies are needed to fully elucidate their distinct mechanistic roles.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1955</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1968</offset><text>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a group of chronic gastrointestinal disorders characterized by inflammation, chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding. The incidence and prevalence of UC are rising globally; its precise pathogenesis remains incompletely defined. Increasing evidence suggests that UC develops through a multifactorial interplay involving genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures, microbial infections, immune dysregulation, and gut microbiota alterations. Dysbiosis, or disruption of the intestinal microbial community, is particularly implicated in UC onset, as it impairs the epithelial barrier, promotes mucosal immune activation, and drives pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This compromise in epithelial integrity increases intestinal permeability, accelerating the progression of the disease. In this context, tight junction proteins (TJPs), which are essential for maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier function, play a key role in UC pathophysiology. Collectively, these interrelated factors support the view that UC is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder driven by disturbances within the intestinal ecosystem.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3208</offset><text>Current therapeutic agents, including corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ACA) derivatives, immunomodulators, and biologics, aim to reduce inflammation for managing IBD. However, these treatments are frequently associated with notable adverse effects, ranging from nephrotoxicity and drug hypersensitivity to gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and exacerbation of diarrhea. Moreover, several therapeutic challenges remain, including primary unresponsiveness or secondary loss of response to treatment (e.g., patients ceasing to respond after an initial benefit) and inability to address the underlying microbiota imbalance. These limitations have redirected attention toward interventions, particularly those capable of modulating mucosal barrier integrity and restoring gut microbiota homeostasis. Within this therapeutic framework, probiotics and postbiotics have emerged as potential modalities to reinforce epithelial barrier function, regulate mucosal immune activity, and restore microbial balance.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4252</offset><text>Probiotics, defined as live microorganisms that confer health benefits to the host, modulate the immune system and enhance the epithelial barrier function through microbial signaling, metabolite production, and host-microbe interaction. Postbiotics, by contrast, are non-viable microbial cells or components derived from probiotics, exerting similar beneficial effects, including immunomodulation and mucosal barrier reinforcement. Given the pathological hallmarks of UC, including mucosal inflammation, impaired barrier integrity, and dysbiosis, both probiotics and postbiotics represent distinctive therapeutic approaches. Probiotics achieve their effects through viability-associated functions like colonization, metabolic activity, and direct immune modulation, while postbiotics provide increased stability and safety by acting independently of microbial viability. The therapeutic efficacy of these two forms may vary based on the disease context, with probiotics offering sustained effects through microbial ecosystem modulation, and postbiotics providing reproducible, safer outcomes by reducing inflammation and restoring epithelial integrity. Understanding the contribution of probiotics and postbiotics is essential for optimizing UC treatment strategies and exploring optimal personalized therapeutic approaches.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5577</offset><text>In this study, we investigated the preventive potential of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei HY2782, in both its probiotic (live) and postbiotic (heat-killed) forms, against DSS-induced colitis.

Current treatments often have side effects, emphasizing the need for safer and more effective therapies that can modulate inflammation and restore dysbiosis with fewer complications. Probiotics are beneficial in IBD, aligning with its pathogenesis, as they enhance intestinal health and help manage or prevent intestinal disorders by blocking inflammatory reactions and altering the bacterial flora. However, since probiotics involve the consumption of live bacteria, there are potential limitations associated with their use. The use of heat-killed probiotics, which retain their functional characteristics, including immunomodulatory and barrier-enhancing effects, could minimize such risks or potential side effects, while providing comparable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits to their live counterparts. Consequently, we aim to investigate the preventive potential of both live and heat-killed L. paracasei HY2782 in alleviating colitis. The primary focus of this study was to understand their distinct mechanisms in reinforcing the intestinal barrier and modulating microbial homeostasis to prevent the onset and progression of colonic inflammation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27408</offset><text>In preliminary in vitro screening assays, both live and heat-killed HY2782 exhibited anti-inflammatory potential in macrophage-based models, supporting their suitability for subsequent in vivo evaluation. Given the limited translational relevance of isolated macrophage responses, the present study focused primarily on epithelial barrier protection and inflammatory outcomes in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model. In this context, inflammatory responses in colitis are known to involve multiple pattern-recognition receptor–associated signaling pathways, including the TLR4–NF-κB axis, which provides a general biological framework for interpreting inflammation-related gene expression changes observed under DSS-induced conditions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28146</offset><text>We also assessed whether these protective effects extended to intestinal epithelial cells, which are crucial for maintaining mucosal barrier integrity in UC.

Impaired epithelial barrier triggers inflammatory cytokine release, disrupts tight junctions, and increases intestinal permeability, contributing to infection and chronic inflammatory diseases. LPS exposure reduced tight junction gene expression and increased cytokine levels, reflecting epithelial dysfunction. However, treatment with live or heat-killed HY2782 restored tight junction gene expression and suppressed cytokine production, suggesting that both probiotics and postbiotics forms of HY2782 may contribute to the preservation of epithelial barrier integrity under inflammatory conditions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29160</offset><text>Based on these in vitro findings, which demonstrate that both the probiotic and postbiotic forms of HY2782 can enhance epithelial integrity and modulate inflammatory responses, we next conducted an in vivo experiment using a DSS-induced colitis mouse model. The DSS model is widely used for its simplicity, reproducibility, and ability to replicate key features of human UC, including acute epithelial injury, mucosal inflammation, and colon-specific pathology. After DSS induction, DAI scores, calculated based on body weight loss, stool consistency, and fecal bleeding, were significantly increased. Additionally, colon length was markedly reduced, and histological scores, including inflammatory cell infiltration, crypt damage, and ulceration, were elevated compared to the CON group. However, the HY2782L and HY2782K groups demonstrated improvements in these physiological and histological alterations, indicating a reduction in disease severity. While the in vitro results indicated that live and heat-killed HY2782 treatments can modulate inflammatory responses and epithelial integrity, in vivo findings demonstrated their protective effects against DSS-induced epithelial injury and mucosal inflammation. These results suggest that live and heat-killed HY2782 may modulate colonic inflammation and barrier dysfunction through multiple complementary actions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30527</offset><text>UC is characterized by impaired epithelial integrity and disrupted tight junction structures, which compromise the intestinal barrier’s selective permeability, increasing susceptibility to microbial invasion and toxin diffusion. Tight junction proteins such as TJP1, TJP2, and OCLN are essential for maintaining barrier function, so strategies that enhance epithelial integrity could provide an important therapeutic approach for UC. In this study, both HY2782L and HY2782K groups restored the DSS-induced downregulation of TJP1, TJP2, and OCLN, indicating their ability to preserve tight junction integrity under inflammatory conditions. Additionally, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β and TNF-α, was significantly reduced in the HY2782L and HY2782K groups compared to the DSS group. Balanced cytokine expression is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis, whereas IBD is characterized by disrupted cytokine regulation due to excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production. The suppression of IL-1β and TNF-α in Caco-2 cells suggests that both HY2782 probiotic and postbiotic can regulate the inflammatory response in DSS-induced colitis, potentially reducing mucosal damage and improving overall disease severity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31794</offset><text>Despite these promising findings, some limitations should be acknowledged. While we evaluated serum cytokines at the protein level, our molecular analyses in colonic tissue were limited to mRNA expression, which did not capture post-transcriptional regulation or protein-level alterations in local inflammatory signaling. In addition, cytokine regulation involves complex interactions among various immune cell populations, which were not comprehensively assessed in this study. Although both live and heat-killed HY2782 exhibited protective effects, the exact mechanisms warrant further elucidation. Based on our findings, the comparable efficacy between the two forms likely results from a functional convergence of host-centered responses. In the acute DSS model, which is primarily driven by epithelial injury and innate immune activation, host-mediated pathways such as pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) signaling may play a dominant role in maintaining barrier integrity. Consistent with this, our in vitro data showed that both live and heat-killed HY2782 modulated TLR4 and NF-κB expression in macrophages (Fig. S1). This suggests that non-viable components retain the capacity to activate immune pathways that attenuate inflammation and reinforce the intestinal barrier. In this acute injury context, these shared host-mediated mechanisms may override viability-dependent effects, leading to similar phenotypic outcomes. Importantly, this similarity reflects the constraints of an acute injury model rather than identical biological actions. Future studies using chronic or therapeutic models are needed to further distinguish the unique mechanistic pathways of probiotics versus postbiotics.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33501</offset><text>Furthermore, the serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and KC were significantly elevated in the DSS group compared to the CON group. These cytokines are key mediators of inflammatory signaling and immune cell activation, playing a pivotal role in exacerbating intestinal inflammation and contributing to tissue damage. Specifically, IL-6 and TNF-α modulate intestinal tight junctions and increase permeability in IBD patients. Excessive IL-1β further increases permeability and activates dendritic cells and macrophages, while KC recruits neutrophils, leading to additional epithelial destruction. There was a significant reduction in the HY2782L and HY2782K groups of these cytokines, suggesting that both forms not only suppressed localized inflammation in the colon but also attenuated the systemic spread of inflammatory responses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34358</offset><text>The reduction in serum inflammatory markers and the increased expression of tight junction genes in the HY2782L and HY2782K groups suggest that both probiotics and postbiotics may help reduce inflammation in colitis and improve gut microbiota imbalance. To investigate the relationship between inflammatory markers and microbial alterations, alpha- and beta-diversity analyses were performed. Consistent with previous studies, DSS induction caused a typical dysbiotic shift, characterized by an increase in Faith’s PD. Given that Faith’s PD reflects phylogenetic diversity rather than species richness, its elevation following DSS treatment likely reflects the expansion of phylogenetically diverse opportunistic taxa driven by epithelial barrier disruption and increased intestinal permeability. Although live and heat-killed HY2782 supplementation showed modest trends toward alpha diversity restoration, the severely compromised intestinal environment under acute DSS exposure appeared to limit substantial community-level recovery. Accordingly, beta-diversity analysis revealed marked DSS-driven microbial composition with minimal separation between the supplementation and DSS groups, suggesting that acute inflammatory pressure masked detectable improvements in overall microbial community composition.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35671</offset><text>After evaluating alpha and beta diversity, taxonomic profiling was performed to assess the microbial groups’ abundance across the CON, DSS, SULF, HY2782L, and HY2782K groups. DSS treatment reduced bacterial families associated with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production, such as Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibaculum, and Lactobacillus, while increasing genera linked to inflammation and epithelial dysfunction, including Erysipelatoclostridium, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Parasutterella. Despite limited recovery in community structure, selective microbial shifts were observed in the HY2782L and HY2782K groups. Live HY2782 treatment increased Lachnospiraceae and completely suppressed Parasutterella excrementihominis, a bacterium associated with colonic inflammation. In the HY2782K group, inflammation-associated taxa, including Bacteroides, were reduced, and Lachnospiraceae increased to levels similar to those observed in the HY2782L and SULF groups, suggesting a compositional shift toward microbial taxa commonly associated with intestinal homeostasis. Notably, Ligilactobacillus murinus, which supports epithelial integrity, was substantially increased in the HY2782K group, surpassing levels in the CON group, an effect not observed in the HY2782L group. One possible explanation is that differences in bacterial viability may influence host–microbe interactions and microbial competitiveness under DSS-induced inflammatory stress. Viable and non-viable bacterial preparations are known to differ in their interactions with the intestinal environment, which may affect the persistence or expansion of specific taxa during acute inflammation. In the present study, however, the precise mechanisms underlying the differential abundance of specific taxa, including L. murinus, were not directly examined and therefore cannot be conclusively determined, although previous studies have suggested that host pattern-recognition receptors such as TLR2 and NOD2 play important roles in mediating epithelial–microbial interactions. In contrast, there was an increase in Lactobacillus in the SULF group, suggesting restoration of the colonic barrier, creating a more favorable environment for Lactobacillus growth. The SULF group did not show a reduction in Parasutterella excrementihominis, which distinguishes its microbial response from that of the HY2782L and HY2782K group. This pattern is consistent with the pharmacological profile of sulfasalazine, which is metabolized in the colon into 5-ACA and primarily exerts anti-inflammatory effects through local immune pathways rather than through modulation of the gut microbiota. Given the limited recovery of overall microbial diversity, the observed taxonomic changes are more appropriately interpreted as being associated with, rather than driving, the anti-inflammatory and barrier-protective effects observed in vivo. As a result, sulfasalazine typically induces only limited shifts in microbial composition, explaining why meaningful microbiota restructuring was not observed in this group despite improvements in inflammatory readouts.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38773</offset><text>Phocaeicola vulgatus, also known as Bacteroides vulgatus, is commonly found in the colonic microbiota of UC patients, with some exhibiting elevated serum antibodies against its OmpA protein, which promotes bacterial adherence. Protease-producing P. vulgatus strains are linked to increased intestinal permeability and active colitis through the secretion of dipeptidyl peptidases. In this study, DSS treatment increased P. vulgatus abundance, with a relatively minor reduction in the SULF and HY2782L groups, while a significant decrease in the HY2782K group. Live bacteria likely exert their effects through direct competition with P. vulgatus by metabolizing organic acids and creating an unfavorable environment for their growth. In contrast, heat-killed bacteria activate intestinal immune responses, enhancing tight junction protein expression through immune receptors like TLR2 and NOD2, thereby strengthening the epithelial barrier. Additionally, heat-killed bacteria do not induce competitive inhibition as strongly as live bacteria, which aligns with the observed increase in TJP gene expression in the colon in the HY2782K group. The results indicate that live and heat-killed HY2782 suppress P. vulgatus through different mechanisms, contributing to improved intestinal barrier function and reduced inflammation in the DSS-induced colitis model. Taken together, the microbiome data indicate that administration of live or heat-killed HY2782 did not induce large-scale restructuring of the gut microbial community under acute DSS-induced inflammatory conditions. Instead, the observed selective taxonomic shifts are more appropriately interpreted as being associated with, rather than driving, the anti-inflammatory and barrier-protective effects observed in vivo.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40548</offset><text>In summary, the present findings indicate that L. paracasei HY2782, administered as either live or heat-killed formulations, has preventive potential against colitis-associated inflammation and epithelial barrier disruption in a DSS-induced model. In line with this objective, the present study was intentionally designed as a preventive proof-of-concept model, and therapeutic administration following disease onset was not evaluated. Taken together, these findings suggest that both live and heat-killed forms of HY2782 can ameliorate inflammatory responses and epithelial barrier dysfunction primarily through host-centered effects rather than extensive microbiota remodeling (Fig. 6). However, these results should be interpreted with caution, as mechanistic differences between live and inactivated preparations were not fully resolved, and the relatively short duration of administration limits conclusions regarding long-term efficacy and microbiome remodeling. Consequently, additional studies incorporating extended preventive dosing strategies, detailed mechanistic investigations, and diverse colitis models will be required to more definitively establish the preventive potential and translational applicability of HY2782.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>41783</offset><text>Supplemental Materials</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41806</offset><text>Supplementary data for this paper are available on-line only at http://jmb.or.kr.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>41888</offset><text> Author Contributions </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>41911</offset><text>Conceptualization, D.L., H.G., J.-W.J., J.-J.S., and J.-H.L.; methodology, software, validation, visualization, and formal analysis, D.L., H.G.; writing-original draft preparation, D.L.; writing-review and editing, J.-Y.K.; supervision, J.-Y.K.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>42156</offset><text>References</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">129</infon><infon key="lpage">139</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Rodriguez-Nogales;given-names:A</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Algieri;given-names:F</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Garrido-Mesa;given-names:J</infon><infon key="name_3">surname:Vezza;given-names:T</infon><infon key="name_4">surname:Utrilla;given-names:MP</infon><infon key="name_5">surname:Chueca;given-names:N</infon><infon key="pub-id_doi">10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.08.005</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">30236870</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">J.
