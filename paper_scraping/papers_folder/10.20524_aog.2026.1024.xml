High levels of stress, anxiety, and depression are common yet often overlooked, negatively impacting treatment adherence and self-care. This review examines how psychological factors influence self-care behaviors in IBD and explores strategies to improve disease management. Following PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024575631), this systematic review applied the PICO model to identify studies involving IBD patients, self-care interventions, and outcomes related to depression, anxiety and stress. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, APA PsycInfo and Google Scholar (October–December 2024). JBI tools were used to assess risk of bias, and evidence was graded using the framework established by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Data extraction and synthesis were performed using structured tables and graphs. IBD patients frequently experience psychological distress that impairs self-care and quality of life. Depression is associated with low self-efficacy and maladaptive coping, while anxiety reduces treatment adherence, particularly in younger patients. Stress contributes to disease management difficulties, reinforcing the need for integrated psychological support. Psychological distress in IBD patients significantly affects self-care behaviors. Incorporating mental health support into standard care may enhance adherence, disease control, and overall well-being.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1729</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1742</offset><text>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic gastrointestinal condition affecting millions worldwide.

Anxiety affects approximately one-third of IBD patients, while depression impacts about one-quarter, with CD patients, particularly women, being at higher risk. Disease activity further exacerbates these psychological conditions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2522</offset><text>Moreover, psychiatric morbidity has also been reported following surgical interventions for IBD, further emphasizing the complex interplay between disease course and mental health outcomes. Several factors contribute to this psychological burden, including disease unpredictability, prognosis uncertainty, fear of surgery, cancer risk, chronic pain and fatigue. Psychological distress is associated with increased disease activity, higher hospitalization rates and frequent disease flares. Additionally, overlapping symptoms, such as fatigue and appetite changes, complicate the diagnosis and management of psychiatric conditions in IBD. Stress can further aggravate symptoms by influencing the immune response and intestinal permeability, with higher stress levels correlating with increased disease activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3333</offset><text>Self-care plays a fundamental role in managing IBD. According to Riegel’s middle-range theory, self-care encompasses 3 key aspects: self-care maintenance (e.g., medication adherence, dietary management, stress reduction), self-care monitoring (symptom tracking), and self-care management (adjusting behaviors or seeking medical attention). However, many patients face barriers to maintaining effective self-care, and psychological distress further impairs their ability to adhere to treatments, engage in health-promoting behaviors and maintain self-efficacy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3895</offset><text>Proactive self-care improves disease outcomes, enhances quality of life and reduces healthcare dependency.

Despite growing awareness of the impact of psychological factors on IBD management, a gap remains in our understanding of how anxiety, stress and depression specifically influence self-care behaviors in this population. This systematic review aimed to address this gap by comprehensively examining the existing literature on the relationship between depression, anxiety, stress and self-care practices among patients with IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4514</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4536</offset><text>Review methodology</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4555</offset><text>This systematic review was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines and following the PRISMA checklist ().</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4748</offset><text>Systematic review protocol registration</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4788</offset><text>The protocol of this systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) of the National Institute of Health Research (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) with the protocol registration number CRD42024575631.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>5055</offset><text>Research question</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5073</offset><text>The present study’s search query was formulated using the PICO model.

To achieve a targeted and precise search, we used a combination of specific keywords and MeSH terms (medical subject headings), using the keywords: “inflammatory bowel diseases”, “Crohn’s disease”, “ulcerative colitis”, “self-care”, “self-monitoring”, “self-management”, “self-efficacy”, “anxiety”, “stress”, “depression” and their variants, appropriately combined by Boolean operators. A manual search was conducted in Google Scholar to retrieve additional records in the gray literature. In the screening phase, 2 expert reviewers (MC and FI) independently assessed all titles and abstracts extracted from the electronic database searches. Using Rayyan software (https://rayyan.com/), duplicates and irrelevant records were systematically eliminated, and a third reviewer (DN) was consulted to facilitate consensus. Full-text articles were obtained for those potentially relevant in the initial screening. Each of these was subjected to rigorous independent assessment by the reviewers (MC and FI), in line with the predetermined eligibility criteria. In situations where consensus was difficult, dialogues were initiated between the primary reviewers. In case of non-agreement, the decision was referred to the third reviewer (DN), previously uninvolved, to ensure an unbiased decision-making process.

Studies of the highest quality, such as systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and well-conducted RCTs, are classified as level 1. In contrast, research primarily relying on expert opinion or lacking empirical backing is placed at level 5. Intermediate-quality studies, such as less rigorous RCTs, cohort studies, and methodologies including case series or case–control studies, are assigned to levels 2, 3 and 4.

Despite the well-documented impact of these conditions on overall health outcomes, their specific influence on self-care behaviors in IBD remains poorly understood. Notably, only 6 studies directly addressed this topic, underscoring a significant gap in the literature. The limited number of studies reveals the scarcity of research dedicated to understanding how mental health interacts with self-management strategies in IBD patients. This is surprising, given the strong bidirectional relationship between psychological well-being and disease activity in chronic illnesses like IBD. Anxiety, depression and stress are likely to impair patients’ ability to adhere to treatment regimens, maintain dietary modifications, and engage in self-care behaviors critical for disease management (Fig. 2).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">AnnGastroenterol-39-1-11-g006.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>21604</offset><text>The figure shows psychological factors in shaping self-care</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21664</offset><text>Depression is a common illness that severely limits psychosocial functioning and diminishes quality of life. Analyzing the main features of depression reveals its profound impact on self-care, particularly in patients with IBD. Depression encompasses a range of emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and physical features that profoundly affect an individual’s daily life. Emotional symptoms include persistent sadness, hopelessness, feelings of helplessness, and heightened irritability, which can undermine motivation and engagement in self-care. Behavioral symptoms often manifest as social withdrawal, diminished interest in activities and neglect of responsibilities, further disrupting routines essential for maintaining health. Cognitive symptoms such as negative thought patterns, impaired concentration, indecisiveness, and feelings of worthlessness create additional challenges in problem-solving and decision-making related to disease management. Finally, physical symptoms like fatigue, sleep disturbances, appetite changes, and somatic complaints add to the overall burden of the illness, compounding the difficulties of adhering to self-care practices. On a more philosophical level, a depressed individual may perceive life as devoid of meaning and purpose. His perspective can lead to a state of resignation, where the individual passively endures life and illness rather than actively engaging in self-care behaviors. This mindset can perpetuate a cycle of neglect, undermining the proactive management of their health and well-being. Consequently, interventions to instill a renewed sense of purpose in life could play a crucial role. Encouraging acceptance of the illness contrary to denial or, in some cases, indifference might yield positive outcomes in terms of self-care behaviors, improved health outcomes and enhanced quality of life. Acceptance enables individuals to approach their condition with greater awareness and adaptability, fostering proactive engagement in managing their health and well-being. Furthermore, it is well-established that psychological interventions can increase levels of self-acceptance, which may further support the development of effective self-care practices and overall resilience.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23902</offset><text>When a new diagnosis is made particularly one that entails long-term, chronic treatment prospects, or more precisely ad vitam, it can provoke a state of anxiety.

On the one hand, anxiety may trigger fear (and vice versa), and catastrophic negative thoughts about one’s condition, leading to an emotional distancing from the identity of being a patient. This can result in avoidance behaviors that steer the individual away from essential self-care practices. The avoidance mechanism can become so overwhelming that the patient passively succumbs to their condition, feeling trapped in doubt and indecision regarding a disease they perceive as uncontrollable, further exacerbated by their mental state.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24669</offset><text>On the other hand, anxiety may drive hyper-controlling behaviors related to the illness, which could paradoxically seem beneficial at first. Such patients might frequently seek explanations from their physician, request additional tests to understand the status of their disease better, or inquire about experimental therapies. However, this can result in overdiagnosis/overtreatment, which may ultimately be harmful to the patient. While this hypervigilance may initially appear as proactive, it often masks the danger of a life overly centered on their illness. In severe cases, this can lead to obsessive–compulsive cycles, dominating their life to the point where it becomes unlivable as they are entirely “subjugated” to the disease. It is therefore essential to strike a balance, avoiding both extremes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25485</offset><text>Targeted interventions to manage anxiety can significantly mitigate its dysfunctional effects, including poor disease management and impaired self-care behaviors. By addressing anxiety, patients may achieve a more adaptive approach to their condition, fostering better health outcomes and quality of life. When discussing stress in its broadest sense, we can assert that it is an integral component of both anxiety disorders and depressive disorders. Stress, defined as the body’s response to any demand or challenge that disrupts its equilibrium, significantly influences disease outcomes. IBD patients face a substantial burden of stress, which significantly impacts their quality of life and disease outcomes. Stress is a well-documented trigger for acute flares in both pediatric and adult IBD patients, further exacerbating disease severity. Stress is an integral part of the disease for many reasons, primarily related to the long-term follow up required, and the necessity of frequent medical visits—as evidenced by the increased number of emergency room visits for IBD-related conditions over time. Additionally, patients face challenges in adapting to social settings, such as dining out, being at work, and participating in social and cultural activities, because of their symptoms. Several studies have shown, across various chronic illnesses and in both patients and caregivers, that stress can negatively impact self-care behavior and health behavior in general. According to theoretical models, stress can overwhelm coping resources, leading to maladaptive responses. Additionally, chronic stress significantly impacts cognitive and emotional functioning, leading to impaired decision-making and decreased adherence to disease management strategies. This was highlighted in a recent cross-sectional study of IBD patients, which identified poor stress coping as a significant predictor of non-compliance, among other factors. Recognizing the detrimental effects of stress, the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation’s guidelines recommend screening IBD patients for psychological distress and offering psychotherapy or psychopharmacological treatment when necessary. Targeting stress has proven to enhance disease outcomes, underscoring the importance of integrated care in managing IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27797</offset><text>Considering the bigger picture, where depression, anxiety, stress, and their impact on self-care coexist, it becomes evident that further research and perhaps even more curiosity is needed to study self-care as a central element in the management and treatment of chronic conditions like IBD. As previously mentioned, our rigorous research identified only 6 articles addressing how depression, anxiety and stress influence self-care in IBD. With this review, we aim to make an appeal to all healthcare professionals working closely with patients affected by IBD. A close collaboration among gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, psychologists and nurses is essential. On the one hand, such collaboration fosters mutual enrichment and knowledge exchange, and on the other, it ensures that the treatment of IBD becomes truly integrated, leaving no aspect unaddressed that could potentially benefit the patient.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28704</offset><text>The small number of included studies (n=6) and the predominance of cross-sectional designs limit the ability to draw causal conclusions. The variability in methodologies and outcome measures may also hinder direct comparisons across studies. The lack of interventional studies further limits our capacity to assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions. Another limitation is that not all available biomedical databases were consulted, which may have resulted in missing relevant studies. Future research should prioritize longitudinal and interventional studies with larger sample sizes to better understand causal relationships and identify effective psychological interventions. The use of standardized assessment tools and more inclusive sample populations would enhance the comparability of results and improve their clinical applicability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29561</offset><text>In conclusion, the findings of this study underscore the critical importance of addressing psychological factors in patients with IBD, specifically depression, anxiety and stress, all of which negatively impact self-care strategies and quality of life. Implementing educational and psychological interventions designed to enhance self-efficacy, reduce anxiety and manage stress could facilitate more effective self-care behaviors. Early psychological involvement is likely to improve treatment adherence and disease management. Integrating psychological support into therapeutic pathways is a crucial strategy to optimize IBD management and enhance patients’ overall well-being.</text></passage><passage><infon
