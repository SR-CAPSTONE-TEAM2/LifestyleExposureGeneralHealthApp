Diet has been suspected of being a contributor to IBD severity as well as intake of antibiotics. Methods: A literary search was conducted on the most recent studies on the subject of IBD, diet, and medical treatment to identify high-quality research findings within this area of research. Research published within the last decade was prioritized. Studies in English language were included in the search, and the knowledge gained was synthesized in the review. Results: Dietary patterns, specifically intake of Westernized diets, were associated with increased inflammation and increased disease severity in patients suffering from IBD, specifically patients suffering from Crohn’s disease (CD). A co-administration of pre- and probiotics was found to contribute to disease remission in ulcerative colitis patients, however, to a lesser extent in patients with CD. A bidirectional effect on the intestinal microbiome was seen as a result of intake of the medicines used for the treatment of IBD patients, which affects both bioavailability of the drug and efficacy of the treatment. The baseline composition of the intestinal microbiome in IBD patients dictates their response to the different treatments. Conclusions: Diet and medical treatment both have a large impact on the architecture of the intestinal Microbiome in IBD patients and are, as such, both essential to understand to enable individualized and optimized treatment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1719</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1735</offset><text>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, which has traditionally been divided into Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). UC is a relapsing, chronic inflammatory disease that is restricted to the colon affecting only the mucosal membrane and is characterized by intermittent bloody diarrhea with pus, abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, and an urgent need of defecation. CD is a chronic, segmental, localized granulomatous disease that can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus, and is transmural. The symptoms are abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea—sometimes with blood—weight loss, ulcers in the mouth, and malabsorption. The etiology of IBD remains unknown; however, accumulating evidence suggests that a combination of dietary factors, intestinal dysbiosis, and abnormal immune response may act as key triggers in disease development.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2679</offset><text>The annual incidence of IBD rates varies geographically, with 10.5 to 46.14 per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe, 1.37 to 1.5 per 100,000 inhabitants in Asia, 0.21 to 3.67 per 100,000 inhabitants in South America, and 7.3 to 30.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in North America. The rising incidence of IBD among children and adolescents highlights the concern that oscillations in hormones may play a role as potential disease triggers. A significantly higher regional prevalence of IBD has been observed in the Faroe Islands, with 106 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. This raises the question of whether the differences in the IBD prevalence across regions are driven by diet, lifestyle, or genetic predisposition.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3384</offset><text>Human gut microbiota plays a central role in host metabolism, immunity, and neuroendocrine function. The gut microbiome also influences the human hormone axis by modulating secretion of serotonin, insulin/leptin, cortisol, estrogen/testosterone, etc., which are speculated as a trigger of IBD among children and adolescents. It is well established that vaginally delivered newborns acquire their initial gut microbiota from their mother during birth and later through breastfeeding—both crucial for healthy gut development. In contrast, infants delivered by cesarean section primarily acquire their early microbiota from the skin and surrounding hospital environment10 and are found to be more exposed to chronic diseases such as IBD and asthma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4132</offset><text>Environmental factors—particularly diet and medication —play a major role in shaping the gut microbiota throughout life.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4257</offset><text>Although genetic predisposition is a well-established contributor to IBD pathogenesis—highlighted by variants in genes such as NOD2, ATG16L1, and IL23R, which influence innate immunity, autophagy, and host–microbiome interactions, the present manuscript is intentionally focused on dietary factors and pharmacological therapies as modulators of the gut microbiome.

Beneficial Dietary Patterns</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9653</offset><text>The high prevalence of IBD in Western countries and newly industrialized countries suggests that environmental exposure, particularly diet, might contribute to the risk of IBD. It is well known that diet shapes the composition of the human gut microbiota and that host cells use microbial metabolites as energy sources and immunomodulatory agents to maintain the intestinal homeostasis. The symbiotic relationship within the gut microbiota is essential for human health. Disruption of this balance, for instance, through increased consumption of Westernized diets, which are rich in fat and poor in fiber, can result in microbial dysbiosis with subsequent gut inflammation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10327</offset><text>IBD profoundly affects nutrient metabolism and nutritional requirements, often leading to altered body composition such as low body mass index (BMI), reduced lean body mass, malnutrition, or in some cases, obesity and hypermetabolism. Many IBD patients report that certain foods exacerbate their symptoms, although the triggers are highly individual. Restricting fermentable carbohydrates could help alleviate non-inflammatory gastrointestinal symptoms for some patients. One of the largest long-term studies on diet and IBD—a 26-year prospective cohort involving 170,776 women—was conducted by researchers Ananthakrishnan et al. (2013). In this study, participants in the ’Nurses’ Health Study’ completed detailed dietary questionnaires every four years. The results showed that long-term dietary fiber intake, particularly fiber derived from fruit, was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing CD, but not UC. Another study by Lopes et al. (2023) investigated the relationship between lifestyle factors—including body mass index (BMI), smoking, physical activity, and the intake of fruits, vegetables, and dietary fiber—and the risk of developing IBD in adults. Participants were drawn from three large U.S. prospective cohorts: the Nurses’ Health Study (year-1976, n = 72,290), the Nurses’ Health Study II (year-1989, n = 93,909), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (n = 41,871). The findings demonstrated that adherence to a healthy lifestyle (based on healthy diet, increased physical activity, no smoking) was associated with approximately a 50% reduction in the incidence of IBD. These results were largely confirmed in three independent European cohorts, suggesting that a substantial proportion of IBD cases could potentially be prevented through lifestyle modifications.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>12152</offset><text>Mediterranean Diet</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12171</offset><text>The Mediterranean diet is based on a traditional diet from Mediterranean countries such as Spain, Italy, France, and Greece, which focuses on fresh non-boiled or non-fried food, high in unprocessed plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, wholegrain cereals, olive oil (saturated fat), moderate fish, and shellfish consumption.

Dose–response relationships are poorly defined, and many studies use widely differing colony-forming unit (CFU) doses, making cross-study comparison challenging. Although probiotics are generally considered safe, adverse events, including bloating, bacteremia in severely immunocompromised individuals, and rare systemic infections, have been reported. More importantly, several well-controlled trials have reported no significant benefit compared with placebo, emphasizing that probiotics cannot yet be considered a reliable therapy for IBD management.

Rigorous donor selection protocols now involve extensive medical history review, serology, stool pathogen testing (including MDRO screening), and repeated assessments. Long-term consequences of altering the gut microbiome remain uncertain, with concerns regarding metabolic, immunological, and oncological outcomes that may emerge years after treatment. Regulatory frameworks differ internationally: in the EU, FMT is regulated variably at the national level (ranging from tissue-based regulation to investigational medicinal product status), whereas the U.S. FDA currently classifies FMT as an investigational product except for recurrent C. difficile infection under enforcement discretion. These issues highlight the need for standardized protocols, harmonized regulatory oversight, and high-quality randomized trials before widespread adoption of FMT in IBD. Under the upcoming EU Regulation on Substances of Human Origin (SoHO; Regulation (EU) 2024/1938), which enters into force on 7 August 2027, stool banks and FMT treatment facilities will be classified as SoHO entities and regulated similarly to blood and tissue establishments.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20777</offset><text>The challenge with FMT is finding healthy stool donors and regularly screening for pathogenic microorganisms to avoid the risk of infection.

Reduced abundance of butyrate-producing Clostridiales species in active IBD leads to lower levels of fecal SCFA, diminishing the epithelial energy supply and the anti-inflammatory signaling while permitting the overgrowth of E. coli. Micronutrient deficiencies (particularly iron, zinc, folate, and vitamin B12) contribute to anemia, which is one of the most common complications associated with IBD. Zinc supports DNA synthesis and immune regulation, while iron, folate, and vitamin B12 are essential for erythropoiesisVitamin D deficiency is common in IBD, affecting gut barrier integrity via E-cadherin induction and promoting antimicrobial peptide production.

Beyond direct immunosuppression, corticosteroids alter the colonic microenvironment and can shift gut microbial communities in both animal models and in humans (including changes in diversity and relative abundances of key taxa in the intestinal tract). These microbiota changes may influence mucosal barrier function and metabolite production (e.g., SCFAs), with potential downstream effects on intestinal mucosal healing and generalized susceptibility to infection. Thus, while steroids are highly effective for induction of disease remission in IBD patients, their effects on the microbiome might contribute to variability in response and to infection risk during therapy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32897</offset><text>Blesl et al., 2024 performed a prospective study of UC patients in active disease states who received systemic corticosteroids, which was associated with a longitudinal restoration of microbial composition and metabolic capacity. The study showed successful steroid treatment tended to shift the microbiome toward a healthier composition. Guo et al., 2022 conducted a study where two induction therapies were compared: exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) versus treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The microbiome analysis of serial CD patients’ fecal samples collected before and after induction therapy showed how treatment with EEN and corticosteroids, respectively, resulted in different trajectories of changes in the gut microbiome. Patients who received treatment with EEN tended to have larger shifts in community composition in their intestinal microbiome compared with patients treated with corticosteroids. This finding indicates that treatment with systemic steroids does change the intestinal microbiome in humans, but the magnitude and direction differ from that of dietary therapy. Comparison of the composition of the microbiotas in the UC patients before and after induction therapy with glucocorticoid vs. fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT, colonoscopy) showed how both therapies significantly reduced the intestinal levels of the inflammation markers TNF-α and IL-10, while treatment with steroids modify the ecosystem different compared with FMT. Li et al., 2023 performed a rat-experiment study which showed that long-term prednisone treatment can cause fungal microbiota dysbiosis (disturbances in the composition of the fungal intestinal microbiome), which affects the ecological interaction between gut mycobiome and bacteriome in the rats.

The microbial metabolism of 5-ASA may reduce its local bioavailability or alter the drug activity, and shifts in microbial community structure with 5-ASA treatment have been reported, Table 3.

Recent research indicates that gut bacteria can influence the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of thiopurine. For example, certain commensal bacteria decrease the conversion of the drug to active metabolites or otherwise reduce the drug bioavailability, which can potentially promote treatment failure. Additionally, immunosuppression itself may alter microbiota composition indirectly via changes in the mucosal immunity.

Multiple studies show that patients who respond to biological therapy often have distinct baseline intestinal microbiome features (higher α-diversity and greater abundance of butyrate-producing Clostridiales such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) compared with IBD patients classified as nonresponders, and it is reported how successful treatment with biological therapy can partially restore a “healthier” microbiome profile in the gut of IBD patients. Conversely, the intestinal microbiome appears to influence biologic efficacy through the modulation of mucosal immune activation, microbial metabolite production (short-chain fatty acid), and intestinal mucosal healing capacity.

Overall, current evidence shows that JAK inhibitors do not directly alter microbial composition but rather normalize dysbiosis through rapid and profound suppression of intestinal inflammation, promoting the recovery of SCFA-producing commensals. However, data are still sparse, sample sizes are small, and more controlled prospective microbiome studies are needed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>39583</offset><text>4.6.

In patients suffering from IBD, antibiotics are used selectively (e.g., for infections, pouchitis, or perianal disease), but the use is associated with both short-term symptomatic changes such as diarrhea and vomiting and longer-term risks such as long-lasting dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>42372</offset><text>In general, antibiotic exposure has been linked to an increased risk of new-onset IBD in epidemiologic studies, and antibiotics can worsen or complicate microbiome-mediated metabolic and immune functions in patients who have already been diagnosed with IBD. At the same time, targeted antibiotic regimens can be therapeutic in certain IBD-related complications, underscoring that antibiotic–microbiome interactions are highly context-dependent. Epidemiological studies show that early-life and repeated antibiotic exposure significantly increase the risk of developing IBD, most likely by perturbing immune tolerance and intestinal barrier function. Furthermore, antibiotics can exacerbate intestinal dysbiosis and impair the metabolic and immunologic regulatory pathways. Conversely, targeted antibiotic regimens, such as metronidazole or ciprofloxacin in patients suffering from perianal localized CD, can be therapeutically beneficial in specific contexts. These findings emphasize that antibiotic–microbiome interactions in IBD are highly context-dependent, capable of both therapeutic and detrimental side effects depending on timing, spectrum, and host factors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>43544</offset><text>5. Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43558</offset><text>Diet and commonly prescribed medications are among the strongest and most influential factors shaping the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Multiple studies indicate that both diet and medication can act as key environmental triggers in the development of IBD in genetically predisposed individuals. Evidence supporting this includes findings that identical twins are often discordant for IBD, demonstrating that genetics alone cannot explain disease onset. Furthermore, higher rates of IBD have been observed among second-generation immigrants, highlighting the strong impact of environmental exposures (particularly diet, lifestyle, and medication use) on disease risk. An increased prevalence of IBD is seen among individuals living in developing countries, which indicates environmental factors such as food and medicine play a significant role in the disease triggers of IBD. It is important to note that eating and drinking, beyond their biological necessity, serve as important psychological and social roles: providing pleasure, comfort, and a sense of belonging. Food is deeply intertwined with social and cultural identity and plays a central part in how people interact, celebrate, and connect with family, friends, and colleagues. Patients suffering from IBD use different food-related strategies to control/manage intestinal symptoms, such as identifying trigger foods, following restrictive diets, control of portion size, and shortening of eating intervals, which might have consequences on the intake of nutrition. As a result of these behavioral strategies and limited knowledge on the effect of dieting on the disease, IBD patients’ food-related quality of life is also affected. Known beneficial diets rich in fiber, omega-3, prebiotics, and fermented foods will promote SCFA producers such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia, which are associated with a healthy gut microbiome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45483</offset><text>However, dietary tolerance varies greatly among patients with IBD, even foods generally considered beneficial. This variability makes it challenging to recommend a single dietary approach for all patients with IBD. Instead, personalized nutrition plans—developed in collaboration with dietitians or nutrition specialists—may yield more favorable outcomes, particularly in patients with CD. It is important to be cautious when providing dietary recommendations to IBD patients as a physician and ensure that patients do not replace or rely on commonly consumed processed foods or beverages, such as cola, which have been shown to exert pro-inflammatory effects on the gut.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46159</offset><text>Maintaining a balance in dietary intake is important, as excessive consumption of otherwise beneficial foods or prebiotics may lead to adverse and unwanted effects in IBD patients. For instance, overconsumption of inulin has been associated with liver dysfunction in experimental studies.

The studies show that corticosteroids induce alteration in the gut microbiota, including metabolic disturbances, fungal microbiota dysbiosis, increased susceptibility to infection, and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Treatment with corticosteroids significantly reduces TNF-α and IL-10, which promotes disease remission in IBD patients. However, given the established importance of the gut microbiome in maintaining overall health, it is reasonable to question if the non-microbiome-related side effects of corticosteroid therapy—such as metabolic and endocrine disturbances, immunosuppression, and increased infection risk (Table 2)—may in fact be mediated, at least in part, induced by corticosteroid-related alterations in gut microbial composition and function. This potential microbiome-dependent mechanism warrants further investigation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>48026</offset><text>Anti-inflammatory Aminosalicylates (5-ASA) are metabolized by the gut bacteria, therefore only IBD patients with the right composition of the intestinal microbiome will experience 5-ASA efficacy. The efficacy of immunomodulators, such as azathioprine, is linked to the composition of the gut bacteria, as certain commensal bacteria decrease conversion of the drug derivatives to active metabolites or otherwise reduce drug bioavailability, which is followed by treatment failure. The studies indicate that immunosuppression itself caused by treatment with immunomodulators may alter microbiota composition indirectly via changes in mucosal immunity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>48676</offset><text>The research shows how the baseline composition of the intestinal microbiome is important, when treating IBD patients with biological therapy such as anti-TNF, anti-integrin, and anti-IL agents. The intestinal microbiome appears to influence the efficacy of biological therapy through the modulation of mucosal immune activation and microbial metabolite production in the gut. Overall, the research reviewed reports how the majority of IBD drugs both shape and are shaped by the intestinal microbiome, which secondly affects drug bioavailability, efficacy, safety, and long-term mucosal outcomes in IBD patients. The baseline microbial composition is a predictor of the efficacy of biological therapy and anti-inflammatory drugs such as aminosalicylates. This enables a new therapeutic opportunity to enhance drug response or reduce toxicity by modulating the gut microbiome through diet and fecal microbiota transplantation. Future randomized controlled studies are warranted to assess the potential of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to beneficially reshape the gut microbiome and thereby enhance the clinical efficacy and durability of biologic therapies in patients with IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>49863</offset><text>While our review initially discusses diet and pharmacotherapy separately, it is increasingly recognized that these factors interact in clinical practice, producing additive, synergistic, or competing effects on gut microbiota.

These interactions can influence inflammation, metabolite production, and overall gut ecosystem resilience. Understanding the combined impact of diet and pharmacotherapy is crucial for designing personalized therapeutic strategies. Future studies should evaluate these interactions longitudinally in human cohorts to determine optimal combinations for restoring microbial balance and improving clinical outcomes in IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>50697</offset><text>6. Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>50712</offset><text>Diet and medication are central modulators of gut microbiota in IBD, and their effects can be beneficial or detrimental depending on context, dosage, and timing. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for guiding precision nutrition and therapy. This review highlights the growing evidence that dietary interventions, pharmacotherapy, and fecal microbiota transplantation can modulate gut microbial composition and influence disease outcomes. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding integrative approaches that combine diet and medication, the limited clinical evidence for FMT in IBD, and the need for larger, well-controlled longitudinal studies. Future research should focus on personalized microbiota-targeted strategies, combined dietary and pharmacological interventions, and mechanistic studies in both human and animal models. The findings have practical implications for clinicians and dietitians, providing a scientific basis for optimizing dietary guidance, therapeutic decisions, and patient management in IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>51767</offset><text>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

A beneficial diet—often associated with the Mediterranean diet and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, prebiotics, and other anti-inflammatory components—can increase the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria, which in turn regulate anti-inflammatory markers such as Interleukin-10 (IL-10). In contrast, a Western diet high in fat and sugar is linked to an increased abundance of pathobionts such as Escherichia coli, which elevate pro-inflammatory factors including Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and IL-6, thereby promoting IBD relapses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">nutrients-18-00009-t002.xml</infon><infon key="id">nutrients-18-00009-t002</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>68325</offset><text>Table shows corticosteroids associated extensive systemic side effects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">nutrients-18-00009-t002.xml</infon><infon key="id">nutrients-18-00009-t002</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
