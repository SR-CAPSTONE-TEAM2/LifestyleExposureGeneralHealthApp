Traditionally, the gut microbiota and the intestinal epithelium have been considered the primary contributors to this dysfunction. However, emerging evidence underscore the crucial role of a third key player: the intestinal mucus. Mucus acts as an equal partner alongside the epithelium and microbiota, functioning as a cell-free interface that filters molecules and toxins while preventing bacterial penetration through its unique structural and compositional properties. Despite its significance, the role of mucus in IBD remains underappreciated, with relative few studies focusing specifically on mucus compared to ones centred on epithelial cells and bacteria. This review explores the features of the intestinal barrier by exanimating each component of the gut mucosa (i.e., epithelium, microbiota, and mucus) from a mucus-centred perspective. In this way, we aim to highlight the crucial role of mucus in IBD and its importance for new potential therapeutic treatments.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1268</offset><text>Graphical abstract</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1287</offset><text>Highlights</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1298</offset><text>Mucus-targeted therapies offer promising avenues for market and research growth.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1379</offset><text>Goblet cells are essential for maintaining mucus production and barrier integrity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1462</offset><text>Mucus regulates bacterial migration, which in turn affects its structural integrity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1547</offset><text>Unique biochemical properties of mucus enable selective barrier functions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1622</offset><text>Mucus-focused therapeutic strategies, including diet, can advance IBD treatments.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1704</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1717</offset><text>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) encompass a spectrum of intestinal pathological conditions marked by a compromised ability to mitigate inflammation, arising from genetic predisposition, poorly understood environmental factors and an imbalanced gut microbial community.

These chronic disorders not only cause significant suffering for patient but also impose substantial socioeconomic burdens (Fig. 1). The estimated doubling in prevalence (from ∼4 to ∼ 8 millions) raises significant concerns, particularly regarding the strain on healthcare systems. As the market for IBD treatments expands, opportunities for innovation increase, fostering the development of more effective therapies, diagnostic tools, and personalized treatments. In this perspective, the growing research interest is crucial for addressing the challenges posed by IBD, driving innovation, intensifying research focus, and uncovering key insights into the causes, mechanisms, and potential treatments of these disease (Fig. 1). Such effort will support the pharmaceutical industry in allocate resources efficiently, developing targeted interventions and ultimately improving patients care and quality of life.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6196</offset><text>The severity and the impact on patients' life vary depending on the specific gastrointestinal pathology. For instance, conditions such as celiac disease can be effectively controlled and managed through gluten-free diets, whereas IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), can be deeply debilitating and currently lack a resolutive drug therapy. Although novel anti-inflammatory treatments, such as anti-TNF-α drugs, have significantly improved patient outcomes, ∼30 %–50 % of IBD patients still experience failure of sustained clinical benefit from these treatments in both short and long term.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6821</offset><text>The diagnosis of CD and UC is complex (Fig. 1), as it relies on techniques developed to identify the shared molecular mechanisms underlying the inflammatory response. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, severe incontinence (more than 10 evacuations per day), colon dilation, continuous bleeding and weight loss are characteristic of UC but not of CD. In CD, the variability of symptoms makes a comprehensive analysis of the patient's history, combined with diagnostic tools such as endoscopy, radiology and histology, the preferred approach for the disease management. In case of CD, inflammation can be patchy and may extend to different districts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, most commonly affecting the ileum and/or colon (95–98 % of cases), with only 2–5 % of cases involving the upper GI tract. In contrast, UC is restricted to colon and typically does not involve the whole thickness of mucosa, unlike CD. Depending on the disease severity, UC inflammation can extend to involve the entire colon (i.e., pancolitis). CD and UC they are commonly recognized as relapsing autoinflammatory diseases that develop in genetically predisposed individuals exposed to environmental factors (e.g., diet, smoke, sanitation and socio-economic status). Exposure to industrial and traffic-related pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide, were associated to the development of IBD in an age-dependent mechanism that remains unclear. Moreover, higher cumulative smoking exposure (measured as cigarettes packs per year) was associated with an increased risk of CD. Interestingly, smoking cessation lowers the probability of developing CD but increases the risk of UC. These contrasting effects suggest that environmental factors should be regarded as integral to IBD pathogenesis, complementing genetic predisposition in predisposition in contributing to disease onset.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8705</offset><text>Although the precise causes of CD and UC remain unknown, and they have traditionally been considered as distinct diseases, a common origin has been hypothesised in recent years.

In a healthy state, SCFA-producing bacteria are abundant and release large quantity of SCFAs (yellow particles). These molecules interact with epithelial and immune cells, enhancing epithelial integrity (via healthy tight junctions), promoting immune tolerance, and facilitating Treg cells maturation. Under IBD condition, a pathological shift in microbiota composition results in a reduced abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria and an increased risk of presence of pathogenic microbes. This leads to immune cells activation and a pronounced production of pro-inflammatory factors, which compromises tight junctions integrity, weakens gut barrier function, and increases permeability of pro-inflammatory bacterial molecules.

Maintaining epithelial integrity ensures a regulated flux of nutrients, water, and ions while preventing the translocation of bacterial molecules or microorganisms. This regulation mechanism primarily depends on tight junctions (TJ) between epithelial cells. TJs consist of several proteins, including claudins, occluding, and others such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), which are sensitive to bacteria-derived molecules and inflammatory mediators. Dysbiosis and inflammation significantly compromise tight junction (TJ) integrity, metabolic processes, and overall epithelium functionality, thereby diminishing the resilience of the intestinal barrier. Bacteria-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate are mainly synthesized by Firmicutes from dietary fibers and play critical roles in TJs modulation and in the regulation of cellular pathways (see Section 4 for an in-depth analysis of dietary impact on microbiota). In vitro studies using Caco-2 cell models have shown that SCFA treatment (i.e., 5 mM butyrate) enhanced claudin-7 expression by  300 %, alongside beneficial upregulation of claudin-1, ZO-1, and occludin, which collectively increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) by 20–30 %, signifying a fortified epithelial barrier with decreased permeability. Furthermore, under inflammatory conditions induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), butyrate has demonstrated efficacy in bolstering epithelial integrity by increasing claudin-3 and claudin-4 synthesis through the activation of the Akt signalling pathway in IPEC-J2 cells, thus offering protective effects against inflammatory and pathogenic insults to the gut barrier.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12600</offset><text>SCFAs serve as principal energy sources for colonic epithelial cells, providing barrier protection, mitigating degradation, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects. Colonocytes (enterocytes of colon region) metabolize butyrate through β-oxidation process, which consumes free-oxygen and establishes an anaerobic environment, favouring the proliferation of obligate anaerobes over facultative anaerobes (e.g., B. fragilis over E. coli). Furthermore, in presence of butyrate, Treg cells promote upregulates the Foxp3 gene, a key transcription factors triggering the Treg cell maturation. A reduction in butyrate concentration (e.g., due to dysbiosis condition) can to lead to the shift of the colonocyte metabolism from β-oxidation to anaerobic glycolysis. This shift increases levels of oxygen and nitrates, promoting the proliferation of facultative anaerobes but also pathogens colonization. Additionally, butyrate depletion reduces Treg cell maturation, promoting inflammation and production pro-inflammatory molecules such as defensins and bacteriocin. TNFα is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by T cells, macrophages, and monocytes during inflammation in both CD and UC. This cytokine activates complex signalling pathways that lead to the endocytosis of occludins and promote the expression of claudin-2 expression, which forms channels for the flux of small cations and water, thereby contributing to leaky epithelial barrier and compromised intestinal integrity in CD and UC.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14100</offset><text>Inflammatory mediators also play a role in regulating epithelial integrity by activating the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway. Nitric oxide (NO) is a reactive molecule synthesized by the inducible NOS (iNOS) through the oxidation of L-arginine, leading to the production of citrullin and NO. In physiological conditions, NO helps protecting the epithelial integrity from oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species. However, in pathological conditions, iNOS activity appears to have the opposite effect, contributing to increased intestinal permeability and prolonged gut inflammation. Indeed, iNOS activity was found significantly higher in colonic biopsies of UC patients compared to control subjects, with elevated level of citrullin and NO. TNFα and the combination of IL-1α and IFN-γ are key mediators in upregulating iNOS expression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14963</offset><text>Interestingly, studies using exogenous NO in colonic epithelium model demonstrated a protective effect even at higher doses, contradicting observations with endogenous NO. The conflicting results in the literature may indicate that while cellular models are valuable for decrypting complex molecular pathways, they currently fail to model the biological phenomenon as a whole. Advanced in vitro models including non-biological components, such as synthetic mucus layers, could help determine whether these contradictions reflect true physio-to-pathological variations or a bias stemming from purely biological approaches without synergy lacking integration with materials science perspectives.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr3.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>15657</offset><text>A) Under physiological conditions, canonical goblet cells (GCs) produce mucus that separates the intestinal microbiota and pathogens from the epithelial tissue. Other subpopulations of GCs also contribute to maintaining homeostasis. For example, inter-crypt GCs produce easily-removable mucus at a fast rate, while non-canonical GCs play a crucial role in facilitating the selective absorption of ions and molecules, including luminal antigens (LAs) and microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). In pathological conditions such as IBD, altered mucus production leads to increased bacterial migration and translocation of MAMPs. Additionally, there is a reduction in the number of sentinel GCs, which locally regulate mucus production, along with an increase in GCs population with a defense profile that produce antibacterial molecules. B) Focus on cell-associated antigen passages (GAPs) formed by GCs (left) and sentinel GCs (right). Under physiological conditions, through a complex spatiotemporal formation of GAPs, GCs deliver luminal antigens to innate immune cells (e.g., mononuclear phagocytes), maturing immune tolerance. Sentinel GCs recognize MAMPs and regulate local mucus production through the release of calcium. Under pathological conditions, GAP-forming GCs can transport bacteria (or their parts), triggering an aggressive immune response, or can become targets for pathogens exploiting GAPs to reach underlying tissues. Excessive MAMPs levels further induce overproduction of calcium by sentinel GCs, which inhibits GAP formation and dysregulates mucus production.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr3.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig</infon><offset>17252</offset><text>Fig. 3</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17259</offset><text>In recent years, goblet cells - highly specialized epithelial cells characterized by their distinctive goblet-like shape - have been recognized as essential mediators of host-microbiota equilibrium (Fig. 3 A). Predominantly located in the gastrointestinal tract, their primary role is mucus production, which forms a critical protective barrier along the intestinal lining, preserving tissue integrity and regulating microbial interactions. These cells first emerge during fetal development around the 12th week of gestation and reach maturity by the 30th week at fetal gut remodeling. In adults, goblet cells originate in the crypts at the base of the intestinal villi, where they are primarily dedicated to mucus production through the synthesis and exocytosis of mucins, which are high-molecular-weight glycoproteins that form the polymeric network of the mucus layer. For these reasons, Goblet cell density and number are often used as indicators of intestinal health and barrier integrity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18254</offset><text>Under physiological conditions, goblet cells are unevenly distributed throughout the gut, with their density increasing toward the distal intestine and peaking near the rectum. In the healthy colon, goblet cells constitute approximately 10–15 % of the epithelial cell population in small intestine reaching up 50 % in the colon. However, in IBD, goblet cell distribution becomes highly heterogeneous, with focal depletion and irregular distribution, especially in inflamed areas. This localized reduction in goblet cell density of  35 %, accompanied by altered mucus production, increases epithelial vulnerability by creating areas of diminished barrier function.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18923</offset><text>In addition to altered density, goblet cells in IBD exhibit metabolic changes. The physiological production of mucus requires goblet cells to synthesize and secrete mucins through a highly regulated process involving post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and proper protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Chaperone proteins, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and calcium-activated chloride channel regulator (CLCA) metalloproteinases, aid in mucin folding by forming disulfide bonds essential for creating a stable, gel-like mucus structure. In IBD, however, ER stress and impaired expression of PDI and CLCA functions lead to misfolded mucins, resulting in improperly folded MUC2 mucins that cannot form the oligomeric structures required for cohesive mucus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19727</offset><text>Furthermore, there is altered expression of other mucus-stabilizing proteins, such as trefoil factor 3 (TFF3, increasing in CD and decreasing in UC) peptides and IgGFc-binding protein (FCGBP, increasing in UC and CD), which normally help stabilize the mucus gel and maintain its physical properties. The of these proteins further destabilizes the mucus barrier in both, making it thinner and more permeable, which fails to effectively protect the epithelium, thereby increasing exposure to pathogens and promoting inflammation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20255</offset><text>In addition to their mucus-secreting functions, goblet cells play essential immunomodulatory roles, especially relevant in IBD (Fig. 3 B). Through goblet cell-associated antigen passages (GAPs), goblet cells transport luminal antigens directly to immune cells in the lamina propria, promoting immune tolerance via the induction of regulatory T-cell development. This antigen delivery mechanism is regulated spatially and temporally, becoming most active during early life when luminal microbial antigensare prevalent. Studies in murine models demonstrate that inadequate GAP function leads to heightened immune responses to microbial antigens later in life, contributing to increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and colitis. A specialized goblet cell subtype, known as sentinel goblet cells, further supports this regulation by actively monitoring microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) via endocytosis. In response to elevated MAMP levels, sentinel goblet cells decrease antigen transport through GAPs and increase mucin secretion to strengthen the epithelial barrier. This dynamic adjustment underscores the adaptability of goblet cells to variations in luminal antigen exposure, aiding immune homeostasis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21487</offset><text>In the context of IBD, the immunomodulatory function of goblet cells becomes dysregulated.

Under physiological condition, bacterial population is highly diversified and mainly characterized by the phyla Firmicutes (i.e., Lactobacillus and Clostridium), Actinobacteria (i.e., Bifidobacterium), Bacteroidetes (i.e., Bacteroides), Proteobacteria (i.e., Escherichia), Fusobacteria (i.e., Helicobacter), with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes representing the 90 % of the whole microbiota composition. The anatomical region of the gut, age, and health status significantly influence the biodiversity and abundance of bacterial populations. For instance, infants of the first year of life have significantly greater biodiversity in Firmicutes and Proteobacteria compared to adulthood, and even more compared to elderly (&gt;70 years). Instead, pathologies like the irritable inflammation syndrome are associated with a reduction in aerobic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, compared to healthy individuals. The intestinal flora contributes to the intestinal barrier homeostasis by inhibiting pathogen infections and regulating nutrients extraction, synthesis and absorption. The gut microbiota can interfere with pathogens adhesion and infection by physically protecting the intestinal mucosa through a prey-predator mechanism or by altering intestinal physicochemical features (e.g., pH). Furthermore, the microbiota promotes the maturation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and stimulates immune cells to maintain responsiveness. For instance, B. fragilis produces the polysaccharide A, which stimulates the maturation of regulatory Treg, thereby promoting immune tolerance and preventing uncontrolled inflammation. Commensal bacteria like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium can further contribute to host defense against pathogen infections by stimulating intestinal epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as defensins, which impair the integrity of pathogens cell and prevent colonization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24339</offset><text>Dietary habits are pivotal in modulating gut microbiota and hence mitigating dysbiosis. Adequate intake of dietary fibers is essential for fostering a healthy gut microbiota and preserving the integrity of the intestinal mucus layer, since they represent the primary substrates for beneficial gut microorganisms, stimulating the production of key immunomodulating metabolites such as B vitamins. In fibers-deficient conditions, the biosynthesis of these vitamins is diminished, resulting in increased microbial consumption and reduced availability for the host, ultimately compromising immune balance. Supplementation with specific fibers, such as inulin, has been shown to restore B vitamin levels and re-establish immune homeostasis, highlighting the importance of targeted fibers intake in promoting health Dietary fibers also promote the production of SCFAs, which serve as critical intermediates for maintaining the mucus barrier by modulating the synthesis and expression of mucin proteins, notably MUC2 (Section 3). The deficiency of dietary fibers further affect the behaviour of mucolytic bacteria, such as A. muciniphila, influencing host susceptibility to pathogens. Under fibers-deficient conditions, A. muciniphila increases mucus layer penetrability, heightening vulnerability to pathogens like C. rodentium. Interestingly, under fibers-sufficient conditions, A. muciniphila was found to exert a protective effect by reducing pathogen load but also by promoting ILC3 in animal models of colitis, reflecting its dual functionality depending on dietary availability. Fibers-deficient diets—common in high-fat or Western dietary patterns—are linked to compromised mucus barrier function, immune dysregulation, and increased inflammation. In the absence of sufficient fibers, gut microbiota adapts by utilizing alternative energy sources, such as host-derived glycans in mucins.

IBD is one of the pathological conditions found to affect both the gut microbiota stability and the intestinal barrier homeostasis, with CD and UC having different impact on gut microbial composition (Table 1). Both conditions reduce bacterial biodiversity and consequently decrease the abundance of key regulators of the bacteria-cells crosstalk. For example, F. Praustnizii, a butyrate-producing bacterium, was found in extremely lower abundance in both CD and UD patients compared to healthy individuals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28148</offset><text>A reduction in butyrate and other SCFAs impairs several SCFA-dependent mechanisms that regulate the immune response by promoting AMP production and by modulating inflammation through the inhibition of NF-κB signalling pathway.

Consequently, manipulating the gut microbiota in patients with CD and UC has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to alleviate symptoms, such as diarrhea and gut inflammation. Probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) are promising strategies in this regard. Although probiotic treatments lack standardization and show variable efficacy, FMT has proven effective in clinical setting, demonstrating success in reversing dysbiosis and achieving symptoms remission. FMT involves the transplantation of fecal microbiota from a healthy donor into an intestinal tract of a recipient. The success of FMT is largely contingent upon the type of dysbiosis, which can be classify as primary or secondary. Primary dysbiosis is typically acute and transient, arising from factors such as antibiotic use, malnutrition or pathogen infection. Conversely, secondary condition is generally chronic and recurrent, often due to side effects of therapies (e.g., chemotherapy) or complex conditions like IBD, irritable bowel syndrome and autism. Multiple factors influence the success of FMT and the likehood of clinical remission: (1) mucosal inflammation; (2) handling of the fecal sample; (3) compatibility between donor and recipient; (4) administration method; (5) frequency of transplants; and (6) pre-treatment with antibiotics. In this context, it is challenging to provide a clear and quantitative definition of the benefits. However, a positive trend is certainly identifiable, especially for IBD. For example, clinical remission rates for FMT vary by condition, with approximatively 25 % remission observed in UC and over 55 % in CD. Effective FMT is associated with increased microbial biodiversity, restoration of Treg cells at the intestinal barrier, enhanced immune tolerance, elevated SCFAs levels, and reduced permeability of the gut barrier to pathogens and bacterial molecules.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>30588</offset><text>Intestinal mucus barrier in IBD</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr4.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig4</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>30620</offset><text>Under physiological condition (left), the mucus composition ensures appropriate surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity) and bulk characteristics (e.g., mucins composition) to limit bacteria penetration and enzymatic activity. In IBD, these compositional defences are compromised, allowing bacteria to more easily penetrate the mucus layer and degrade the mucins network, which is characterized by reduced enzymatic resistance. The pathological scenario is further exacerbated by the structural weakening of mucus. For example, exposed portion of the gut epithelium and variations of mucus thickness facilitate bacterial infections and promote the diffusion of pathogenic toxins or molecules. This weakening of mucus properties both in terms of chemical composition and structural integrity, contributes to persistence of chronic inflammation, which is central to the pathology of IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">gr4.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig4</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig</infon><offset>31507</offset><text>Fig. 4</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31514</offset><text>The intestinal mucus is a biological hydrogel that envelops the entire intestinal tract. It features a sophisticated bi-layered structure that supports symbiotic microbiota growth while preserving the sterility of the gut epithelium and modulating the passages of molecules between bacteria and cells. The polymeric network within the mucus consists of trimers of the gel-forming mucins, specifically MUC2 in the intestine and MUC5A in the stomach. This network is further stabilized by specific structural proteins, such as IgGFc-binding protein (FCGBP) and trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) through disulphide bonds formations. The gel-forming mucins are composed of many amino acids tailored to their specific location in the intestinal tract, yet they retain highly conserved structure: a linear protein core with numerous O-glycosylated branches. These branches contribute significantly to the molecular weight of the mucins, reaching up to 5 MDa. Additionally, gel-forming mucins are supported by transmembrane mucins, such as MUC1, MUC3 and MUC4, which do not participate in the polymeric mucus network but play essential roles in biological functions like lubrication, bacterial adhesion, and inflammation signalling. In disease states, particularly in IBD, the homeostasis of the mucus ecosystem is disrupted both chemically and physically. This disruption alters the delicate balance between the microbiota (which resides in the mucus), the mucin-secreting cells, and biomolecules that diffuse in the network (Fig. 4).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>33034</offset><text>Compositional variation</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33058</offset><text>In UC, both the quantity and quality of mucus are diminished, affecting not only the bulk mucus production by gut tissue but also the mucus secreted at the single-cell level.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33233</offset><text>Proteomic analysis revealed alterations in the mucus protein core of UC patients, with a decrease of both gel-forming, transmembrane mucins, and other structural proteins (e.,MUC2, MUC4, MUC3, FCGBP and CLCA1) accompanied by an increase in inflammation-related proteins.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33504</offset><text>IBD are associated with changes not only in mucins production but also in mucins composition.

One of the main structural parameters of this barrier is its thickness, as it is closely related to the function of the specific intestinal region. For example, in the small intestine, where nutrients absorption occurs, the mucus thickness is minimal thus facilitating the diffusion of the molecules from the lumen to the tissue. In contrast, in the colon, where the majority of the intestinal microbiota resides, the mucus layer is significantly thick providing protection against infections (Table 3).

In vivo animal models of induced moderate UC have demonstrated limited changes in overall mucus thickness but a substantial alterations in mucus architecture, notably and increase in the thickness of the adherent layer compared to controls. These results suggest that both quantity and quality of mucus are crucial elements in IBD. This concept is further supported when considering mucus permeability as an indicator of barrier efficacy. Studies have shown that microbeads with dimension comparable to bacteria (0.5–2 μm) can penetrate the mucus and reach the epithelial surface in both ex vivo human biopsies and animal models, highlighting compromised barrier in properties in IBD. Similarly to the changes in thickness, the weakening of the mucus barrier also increases with the disease severity. Specifically, the percentage of microbeads reaching the epithelium was 36 % in the case of acute disease, 20 % during remission state, and only 10 % in healthy controls. As structural properties of mucus correspond to its chemical composition, the impaired barrier was linked not only to a reduction in content of the gel-forming mucin MUC2 but also to a decrease of the support protein FCGBP. This suggests that UC involves two combined effects: a reduction in mucus production and a structural instability of the mucins network.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>41049</offset><text>Barrier integrity and permeability assays</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41091</offset><text>The integrity and permeability of the intestinal barrier are standard parameters used in clinical practice to assess and define the severity of IBD.

Recently, new approaches – utilizing bioinspired materials, mucus models, and microfluidic devices – have been developed to better assess the impact of mucus on the transport of bacterial products. These methods highlight the crucial role of mucus in intestinal barrier function, particularly due to its strong barrier effect in reducing the apparent permeability (Papp) of drugs, nanoparticles and quorum sensing molecules. Despite being in vitro, these studies emphasize the need for a more detailed characterization of mucus properties to enhance our understanding of gut barrier permeability. For instance, investigating changes in the microstructure of the mucus network as it shifts from physiological to pathological conditions could reveal whether the diffusion of molecules from the lumen to the epithelium is facilitated or impeded. Such insights could pave the way for new drug development strategies and enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. Likewise, analysing compositional changes in mucus could clarify how different molecules interact with the mucus matrix, ultimately influencing their permeability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>43987</offset><text>Confocal laser endomicroscopy</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>44017</offset><text>Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) enables the acquisition of confocal images during endoscopic procedures, providing detailed insight in epithelial morphology.

CLE produces high-resolution images that reveal detailed information about barrier morphology and architecture of the epithelial crypts. These analyses have identified characteristic morphological changes in IBD epithelia, including increased intra- and inter-crypt distance, irregular crypt organization, and the presence of micro- and macro-lesions that lead to cellular infiltration. Overall, CLE not only provides essential data regarding epithelial barrier impairment but also reduces the need for biopsies to only the most necessary cases.

This technique requires intestinal tissue biopsies, which imply invasive procedures to obtain ex vivo specimens. The method measures the voltage difference (ΔVEP) and a transepithelial (o transmucosal) electric resistance (TEER o TER, respectively) across the apical and the basolateral sides of the barrier. Active transport is stimulated by introducing specific ions or molecules on either side of the epithelial barrier, while both ΔVEP and TER are recorded to determine epithelial barrier properties. The ΔVEP is a direct measure of ion movement, whereas TER provides a quantitative measure of the resistance to ion flow across the epithelial layer, indicating the integrity of tight junctions. Reduced TER values suggest compromised tight junction integrity and increased epithelial permeability. By monitoring changes in these parameters, the Ussing chamber method provides a detailed assessment of ion transport dynamics, barrier strength, and functional status of the epithelial layer. Like other established clinical assays, the Ussing chamber method is a valuable approach for studying intestinal barrier function in IBD.

While researchers have proposed different hypotheses in their challenging quest to determine the origins of these diseases, the pathophysiology of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains incompletely understood. Within this context, the concept of a leaky intestinal barrier is well-established, wheatear it is regarded as a trigger or symptom of the disease. Historically, the leaky barrier in IBD has been primarily linked to dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier and dysbiosis. However, this phenomenon also involves another, often overlooked, cell-free player: the intestinal mucus. In this intricate interplay, the chemical and physical properties of mucus work in synergy with bacterial and cellular metabolism, influencing the diffusion of bacterial- and cellular-derived molecules while modulating the inflammatory response. Although significant advancements have been made in understanding IBD through the traditional perspective (e.g., defining standard analysis methods), incorporating a refined characterization of mucus offers promising new paths for achieving a comprehensive understanding of IBD. Indeed, adopting an integrated approach that consider both biological- and mucus-specific perspective could lead to novel etiological and pathogenic insights, as well as alternative therapeutic strategies for managing IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>53442</offset><text>CRediT authorship contribution statement</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>53483</offset><text>Giuseppe Guagliano: Writing – original draft, Visualization, Formal analysis.
