The gut microbiome, composed primarily of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, immune balance, and neuroimmune signaling. Disruption of this microbial ecosystem is characterized by loss of beneficial short chain fatty acid producing bacteria and expansion of pathogenic species which promotes mucosal inflammation, cytokine release, and neuroimmune signaling that can disrupt mental health through the gut-brain axis. Emerging evidence links microbial metabolites, vagal tone, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in a feedback loop that perpetuates inflammation and alters mood regulation. Current therapeutic approaches include diet modification, osteopathic manipulative treatments, fecal microbiota transplantation and phage therapy. This article focuses on understanding mechanisms linking dysbiosis, immune activation, and neuroinflammation to guide future interventions. A holistic model addressing the gut-brain axis holds the greatest promise for improving outcomes and personalizing care for IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1439</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1452</offset><text>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) represents a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with significant physical and psychological effects. IBD can have genetic predispositions and environmental triggers that can cause gut microbial imbalances and immune dysregulation. Despite therapeutic advances, disease heterogeneity and unpredictable relapsing complicates management. Studies have shown that both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, the major forms of IBD, are associated with disruptions to the intestinal epithelium and mucosal immunity that promote sustained inflammation and systemic immune activation. Beyond gut disorders, studies have also shown that SARS-CoV-2–induced ACE2 dysregulation disrupts gut microbiota and the renin–angiotensin system, driving inflammation and neurological dysfunction that contribute to long COVID symptoms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2343</offset><text>Central to IBD pathophysiology is gut microbiome ‘dysbiosis’ which can alter intestinal permeability, immune signaling, and barrier integrity. In healthy individuals, the gut microbiome is predominantly composed of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, which generate short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate and propionate critical for energy provision and immune regulation. Dysbiosis, characterized by altered microbial diversity and composition, is closely associated with IBD pathogenesis, as evidenced by both experimental models and clinical observations. Loss of anti-inflammatory species and increased pathogenic bacteria heighten mucosal dysfunction and systemic inflammation. In IBD patients, microbial community shifts are evident, marked by a reduction in beneficial Firmicutes, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia hominis, alongside an increase in potentially pathogenic Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. This dysbiotic state correlates with diminished SCFA production and impaired microbial diversity, compromising intestinal barrier function and promoting inflammation. Pathogenic species such as adherent-invasive Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, and Listeria monocytogenes have been implicated in disease exacerbation. Whether dysbiosis is the driver of inflammation or result of it remains a central question, but interventional studies with fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics point to their interrelatedness.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3850</offset><text>Emerging research incorporates the gut–brain axis into IBD frameworks to explain the high rates of mood and cognitive disorders seen in patients. Neuroimmune signaling, vagal pathways, and stress-driven hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) activation connect gut inflammation to altered brain function and behavior. Circulating cytokines and microbial metabolites can affect glial and neural pathways, linking intestinal pathology to depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits. Thus, understanding the molecular and inflammatory relationship between the gut and brain provides a foundation for IBD management that targets microbiota composition, immune modulation, and psychological health.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4544</offset><text>Genetic Susceptibility, Environmental Factors, and Immune System Interactions in IBD</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4629</offset><text>The pathogenesis of IBD results from the convergence of host genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, immune dysregulation, and microbial perturbation. Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 240 IBD-related loci, many of which encode proteins involved in innate immune sensing, epithelial barrier function, and autophagy. Genes such as NOD2, ATG16L1, CDC42, and ORMDL3 contribute to microbial recognition and mucosal homeostasis; their dysregulation promotes exaggerated immune responses to commensal bacteria. Recent work from Agrawal and colleagues highlights CDC42 and ORMDL3 regulatory patterns as potential therapeutic targets for controlling mucosal and metabolic inflammation in IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5346</offset><text>Environmental influences– diet, antibiotic exposure, infections, early-life microbial colonization– further shape disease risk by altering microbial composition and immune tolerance. Diets low in fiber and high in animal fat reduce microbial diversity and the production of anti-inflammatory SCFAs such as butyrate, propionate, and acetate. Conversely, plant-based diets enrich SCFA-producing genera and support epithelial barrier integrity. Bacaloni and Agrawal emphasized how nutritional patterns and epigenetic modification jointly modulate the microbiota and immune signaling, illustrating how diet serves as a bridge between genetic predisposition and immune activation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6026</offset><text>Immunologically, IBD involves chronic activation of Th1/Th17 responses, inflammasome signaling, and impaired regulatory T-cell activity. The NLRP3 inflammasome, in particular, connects dysbiosis and metabolic inflammation to intestinal and systemic pathologies. Malicevic and colleagues demonstrated that NLRP3 activation contributes to both IBD and diabetes via gut microbial alterations, suggesting a shared inflammatory circuitry. Such systemic inflammation has neuropsychiatric consequences: cytokines like IL-6, TNF-ɑ, and IL-1β cross the blood-brain barrier, modulate neurotransmitter metabolism, and induce microglial activation, contributing to mood disorders.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6702</offset><text>Mechanistic Pathways Linking Gut Inflammation and Mental Health</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6766</offset><text>Barrier dysfunction and immune activation</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6808</offset><text>In both IBD and IBS, epithelial barrier breakdown permits translocation of bacterial antigens and metabolites, stimulating mucosal and systemic inflammation.

A heavily interconnected network that frames a major component of the gut-brain axis is the gut microbiota, making it a reasonable target for therapy. In COVID-19 patients, there was a statistically significant improvement in remission rate in probiotic treated patients compared to controls. Prebiotics such as lactulose, lactosucrose, oligofructose, and inulin have been found to induce the growth of certain host microflora resulting in enriched enteric function. A combination of synergistically acting prebiotics and probiotics, known as synbiotics are supposed to selectively stimulate growth and/or activation of the metabolism of intestinal microbiota positively affecting the host. Adults IBS patients had a significant reduction in the severity of IBS symptoms with multi-strain synergistic therapy. There is rising evidence indicating the modulation of prebiotics and probiotics on the human gut microbiota and its alterations towards a healthier composition for patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11484</offset><text>Dietary Interventions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11506</offset><text>The diet has the strongest and most direct influence over the microbiota of the gut profile.

OMT demonstrated a reduction in TNF-ɑ in patients with chronic low back pain. Additionally, OMT has shown to promote balance of the autonomic nervous system by attenuating sympathetic activity and increasing parasympathetic activity. These ideas can be applied to reducing the increase in cytokines occurring with IBD patients. Various soft non-manipulative treatments on Crohn’s disease including cranial, myofascial and visceral techniques improved overall and physical quality of life.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>13808</offset><text>Future Directions and Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13841</offset><text>IBD arises from a complex interplay of genetic susceptibility, immune dysregulation, environmental influences, and gut microbial imbalance. Dysbiosis and chronic inflammation extend beyond the gut, affecting neural pathways that regulate mood and cognition. Cytokine signaling, impaired mucosal function, and altered microbiome metabolites disrupt serotonin synthesis and contribute to CNS symptoms frequently observed in IBD. This bidirectional relationship between inflammation and the CNS reinforces disease persistence and impacts quality of life. Similarly gut, brain, and immune interactions seen in conditions like long COVID highlight shared systemic mechanisms. Dietary interventions, particularly the Mediterranean diet, can positively shape gut microbiota and serve as therapy for IBD. Emerging treatments such as fetal microbiota transplantation and phage therapy aim to restore healthy gut balance and target harmful bacteria, though more research is needed for consistent efficacy. OMT may also benefit IBD patients by reducing inflammation, balancing autonomic activity, and improving quality of life through gentle, non-invasive techniques. Effective management requires an integrative approach that targets both the gut and CNS through microbiome and neuroimmune therapies. Future research should clarify the causal links between dysbiosis, immune activation, and CNS outcomes to guide more precise, personalized treatment options. Understanding the gut brain axis will be key to developing personalized and holistic treatment strategies for IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>15405</offset><text>Competing interests:</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>15426</offset><text>All authors have read the manuscript and declare no conflict of interest.
