Identifying molecular mediators involved in inflammation and tissue repair is critical for improving disease management. Objective: To examine the expression of periostin, TGF-β, and SLUG in pIBD and assess their potential roles in intestinal inflammation, fibrosis, and mucosal healing. Methods: Intestinal biopsies from 33 pediatric patients (11 CD, 22 UC) and 10 healthy controls were analyzed immunohistochemically. Quantitative PCR evaluated POSTN, TGF-β1, and SNAI2 expression in 22 patients and 6 controls. Correlations with fecal calprotectin, the Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), and the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) were determined. Results: Periostin, TGF-β, and SLUG expression were significantly increased in pIBD compared with controls. Periostin levels were higher in CD than in UC. All markers correlated positively at mRNA and protein levels. Notably, periostin showed an inverse correlation with fecal calprotectin and PCDAI scores. Conclusions: Periostin, TGF-β, and SLUG may represent biomarkers of pIBD activity. Periostin appears to mediate inflammation and promote mucosal fibrosis or repair, and its inverse association with disease activity suggests a potential therapeutic role in pIBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1585</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1601</offset><text>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic gastrointestinal disorders characterized by periods of exacerbation and remission that include Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and IBD-unclassified (IBD-U). The incidence of IBD, particularly CD and UC, is steadily increasing in both children and adults worldwide.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1938</offset><text>IBD is often diagnosed at a young age, and in pediatric patients four subgroups are distinguished based on age at onset: adolescent-onset (10–18 years), early-onset (6–9 years), very early-onset (VEO-IBD, &lt;6 years), and infantile-onset (&lt;2 years). Pediatric IBD (pIBD) generally exhibits faster progression, greater extent of intestinal involvement, and more complex phenotypes compared to adult-onset IBD. The disease is driven by genetic, microbial, immunological, and environmental factors, along with their interactions. A positive family history is also a major risk factor in pIBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2530</offset><text>The clinical presentation of IBD depends on the location and extent of lesions. In CD, inflammation most often affects the ileocolonic region, though it may occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Transmural inflammation leads to destruction of the intestinal wall, fibrosis, and formation of strictures and fistulas. UC, in contrast, involves continuous superficial inflammation spreading proximally from the rectum. Three forms are distinguished—proctitis, left-sided colitis, and pancolitis—depending on disease extent. Clinically, UC patients experience rectal bleeding, tenesmus, and urgency. Disease activity is typically assessed using fecal calprotectin and pediatric scoring systems: the Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI). Calprotectin, a calcium-binding protein constituting nearly 45% of neutrophil cytoplasmic content, reflects the severity of mucosal inflammation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3494</offset><text>Fibrosis is a frequent consequence of chronic intestinal inflammation. Approximately 30–50% of CD and 1–12% of UC patients develop fibrosis-related complications, which negatively affect disease course and quality of life. Strictures are classified as inflammatory (potentially reversible, responsive to anti-TNF-α therapy) or fibrotic (requiring endoscopic or surgical intervention). In CD, fibrotic strictures are often irreversible and recur even after resection. Disease progression can follow non-stricturing (B1), penetrating (B2), or stricturing (B3) behavior, with most patients eventually developing structural complications. In UC, fibrosis is typically limited to the mucosa and submucosa, although severe cases may exhibit deeper wall involvement and impaired motility.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4281</offset><text>A key mechanism underlying tissue remodeling in chronic inflammation is epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), during which epithelial cells lose polarity and adhesion and acquire mesenchymal characteristics such as motility, invasiveness, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. EMT is regulated by transcription factors including SNAIL, SLUG, TWIST, ZEB1, and ZEB2, which repress epithelial markers (e.g., E-cadherin) while promoting mesenchymal proteins (e.g., vimentin, N-cadherin). This process is modulated by TGF-β, Wnt, Notch, and Hedgehog signaling and can be induced by hypoxia and inflammatory cytokines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4905</offset><text>In IBD, overexpression of EMT-related transcription factors such as SNAIL and SLUG has been observed in damaged intestinal crypts, extending to mesothelial and subserosal fibroblasts, particularly in fibrotic areas. Increased TGF-β1 expression and nuclear accumulation of SLUG in fibrotic regions have been reported, accompanied by β-catenin activation and fibroblast proliferation, while TGF-β1 was shown to induce SLUG-dependent L1CAM upregulation and epithelial motility. In Crohn’s disease-associated fistulae, SLUG expression is predominantly localized to peripheral fibrotic regions, suggesting its involvement in stromal remodeling.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5554</offset><text>Periostin, an extracellular matrix protein encoded by the POSTN gene, regulates cell–matrix adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation through interactions with integrins. Initially identified in bone tissue, periostin is now known to participate in diverse physiological and pathological processes including skin and cardiac remodeling, bronchial fibrosis in asthma, and bone marrow fibrosis. Recent studies suggest that periostin may also contribute to intestinal fibrosis in IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6041</offset><text>Periostin expression is often linked with EMT-related transcription factors, particularly SLUG, in fibrotic and neoplastic tissues. For example, periostin enhances EMT through the ILK–Akt–SLUG pathway in endometrial epithelial cells, while co-expression of periostin and SLUG has been observed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and in epicardium-derived cells during cardiac fibrosis. Importantly, periostin is recognized as a key mediator of inflammatory and fibrotic remodeling across various organs, suggesting it may play a similar role in IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6588</offset><text>Considering these findings, our study aimed to analyze the expression of periostin, SLUG, and TGF-β in the intestinal tissues of pediatric IBD patients and to assess potential correlations between these molecular markers and clinical disease activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6843</offset><text>2.

Diagnosis of IBD, CD, or UC was based on clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological criteria, and disease activity was assessed using the PCDAI (for CD) and PUCAI (for UC) scales. All biopsies were collected during active disease. The control group consisted of 10 children without IBD in whom organic gastrointestinal disease was excluded. These children were hospitalized for abdominal pain and/or chronic diarrhea, but during colonoscopy no macroscopic abnormalities were observed, and histological evaluation of biopsies from the cecum, transverse colon, sigmoid colon, or rectum showed no features of IBD. Inclusion criteria for patients with IBD included newly diagnosed disease or clinical features of exacerbation, while exclusion criteria for all participants included: acute conditions (trauma, infection, exacerbation of chronic disease), chronic inflammatory diseases, chronic kidney diseases, and endocrine disorders. Biopsies from representative sites (terminal ileum, cecum, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon or rectum) were collected for immunohistochemical and molecular analyses. In some cases, biopsies from sections showing the most severe macroscopic changes were used.

Activity of endogenous peroxidase was blocked using EnVision FLEX Peroxidase-Blocking Reagent (5 min; RT, Agilent). The following primary antibodies were applied for 20 min at RT: periostin (1:100, NBP1–82472, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), TGF-β1 (1:100, NBP2–22114, Novus Biologicals), and SLUG (1:50, sc-166476, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Next, the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (EnVision FLEX/HRP, 20 min at RT) (Agilent). The reactions were visualized using freshly prepared DAB (diaminobenzidine), with incubation for 10 min at RT. Additionally, all the slides were counterstained with FLEX Hematoxylin (Agilent) for 5 min at RT and dehydrated in graded ethanol concentrations (70%, 96%, 99.8%) and then xylene. Finally, the slides were mounted in Mounting Medium (Agilent). All antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Agilent). Positive controls for the antibodies were performed using tissues recommended by the manufacturers, according to the provided protocols: breast carcinoma for anti-periostin and anti-SLUG antibodies, and lymph node for the anti-TGF-β antibody. The negative control consisted of reactions performed without primary antibodies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11032</offset><text>2.3.

Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) reactions were performed in 20 µL volumes using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and run on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The following TaqMan Gene Expression Assays were used: TGF-β1–Hs07289533_m1, POSTN–Hs01566750_m1, SNAI2 (SLUG)–Hs00161904_m1, and ACTB–Hs99999903_m1 as a reference gene. Thermal cycling conditions were 50 °C for 2 min (polymerase activation), 94 °C for 10 min (initial denaturation), followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s (denaturation) and 60 °C for 1 min (annealing/extension). Each reaction was performed in triplicate. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method, normalized to ACTB expression.

This method takes into account two parameters: the percentage of positively stained cells (A) and the staining intensity (B). The final score was calculated as the product of these two values (A × B). Detailed criteria are presented in Table 3. According to the IRS scale, a reaction was considered positive when at least 1% of the cells in the specimen exhibited weak staining. In addition, the nuclear expression of the SLUG protein was assessed using a semi-quantitative scoring system based on the proportion of tumor cells showing positive nuclear staining: 0%—0 points; 1–10%—1 point; 11–25%—2 points; 26–50%—3 points; and 51–100%—4 points. All specimens were examined with an OLYMPUS BX-41 light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) by two independent pathologists. In cases of discrepant results, the slides were re-evaluated jointly until a consensus was achieved. Inter-observer agreement prior to consultation was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with a two-way random-effects model, absolute agreement, and single measurements. The obtained ICC value was 0.95, indicating excellent agreement between observers. In accordance with the antibody manufacturers’ recommendations, positive and negative control reactions were performed prior to the main IHC analyses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13761</offset><text>2.5.

Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28518</offset><text>In this study, we demonstrated that periostin and SLUG are significantly upregulated in intestinal tissue from pediatric patients with IBD, including both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), compared to controls. Importantly, the expression of both markers showed a positive correlation with TGF-β and overlapping localization in the connective tissue, suggesting a coordinated role in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrosis of the chronically inflamed intestinal wall. To our knowledge, this is among the first studies to quantitatively and semi-quantitatively assess periostin at both the gene (RT-PCR) and protein (IHC) levels in pediatric IBD, addressing a critical gap in knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms of intestinal fibrosis in this population. These results confirm the involvement of periostin in IBD pathogenesis and indicate that periostin may actively contribute to tissue remodeling and EMT-associated processes in children.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29502</offset><text>Fibrosis represents one of the most clinically relevant consequences of chronic intestinal inflammation. In Crohn’s disease, persistent transmural inflammation promotes irreversible fibrotic remodeling, leading to strictures, obstruction, and penetrating complications, whereas in ulcerative colitis, fibrotic remodeling is usually limited to superficial mucosal layers. More than half of CD patients eventually develop a stricturing or penetrating phenotype within two decades of diagnosis, and 70–80% require intestinal surgery. Postoperative recurrence of fibrosis, particularly at the ileocecal anastomosis, is common and poses a major therapeutic challenge.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30169</offset><text>On a cellular level, chronic inflammation triggers EMT—a process in which epithelial cells lose polarity and intercellular adhesion and acquire mesenchymal properties such as motility and extracellular matrix production. This process is regulated by transcription factors including SNAIL, SLUG, TWIST, ZEB1, and ZEB2, which downregulate epithelial markers like E-cadherin and induce mesenchymal proteins such as vimentin and N-cadherin. EMT activation is driven by signaling pathways such as TGF-β, Wnt, and Notch and is strongly modulated by inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30751</offset><text>Previous studies have shown marked overexpression of SNAIL and SLUG in damaged intestinal crypts of IBD patients, extending into mesothelial and subserosal fibroblasts, especially in fibrotic regions. Scharl et al. demonstrated increased TGF-β1 expression and nuclear accumulation of SLUG in fibrotic intestinal areas, accompanied by β-catenin activation and fibroblast proliferation, while Schäfer et al. reported that TGF-β1 induces SLUG-dependent L1CAM upregulation, enhancing motility and apoptosis resistance. These findings collectively underscore the role of inflammatory signaling in EMT-driven intestinal fibrosis, consistent with our observation of periostin–SLUG–TGF-β co-expression in pediatric IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31475</offset><text>Although data on periostin expression in IBD are limited, previous studies provide important context. Kikuchi et al. reported high periostin expression in the lamina propria and pericryptal connective tissue of UC patients. In experimental mouse models of colitis, POSTN knockout mice (POSTN −/−) exhibited reduced disease severity and fewer inflammatory cell infiltrates compared to wild-type controls after induction with DSS or TNBS, whereas administration of recombinant periostin restored severe inflammation, and neutralizing antibodies against periostin alleviated it. These findings support the immunomodulatory role of periostin in regulating the recruitment and activity of inflammatory cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, in the intestinal mucosa. Consistent with these observations, we found higher expression of periostin and TGF-β in pediatric IBD tissues compared to controls, with a positive correlation between their mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that periostin may act in concert with TGF-β to promote chronic inflammatory and fibrotic processes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32582</offset><text>A plausible mechanism is that TGF-β signaling induces periostin production, while periostin, through αvβ3/αvβ5 integrin and ILK activation, enhances TGF-β signaling and reinforces ECM deposition and EMT, forming a positive feedback loop that perpetuates fibrosis (as illustrated in Figure 8). This molecular interaction is well-documented in other tissues, further emphasizing periostin’s cross-organ profibrotic role.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33021</offset><text>A key strength of our study is the analysis of periostin directly in intestinal tissue rather than serum, which avoids potential confounding factors in the pediatric population. Notably, circulating periostin levels are highly influenced by age-dependent growth and bone metabolism, resulting in substantially higher plasma concentrations in children compared to adults, as well as by circadian variation, BMI, and smoking status. This tissue-based approach allowed a more precise assessment of the local role of periostin in the intestinal wall, independent of systemic fluctuations. Our results also highlight the potential importance of periostin in the chronic phase of inflammation, when fibrotic remodeling predominates, suggesting that periostin may serve as a tissue biomarker for early fibrotic changes in pediatric IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33851</offset><text>The relevance of periostin to fibrotic processes is further supported by its established role in fibrosis of multiple organs, including subepithelial bronchial fibrosis in asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, myelofibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and post-ischemic myocardial fibrosis. In these contexts, periostin not only reflects ongoing fibrogenesis but actively contributes to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and EMT, processes that are mirrored in our observations of the intestinal wall in pediatric IBD. Furthermore, due to the specific role of the subepithelial connective tissue of the bronchial wall, circulating periostin concentrations in blood serum have been used as markers of asthma progression or the advancement of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (particularly the monomeric form), and pilot studies suggest its potential utility as a biomarker for airway epithelial inflammation, including allergic rhinitis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34783</offset><text>SLUG, a transcription factor and recognized marker of EMT, was also significantly upregulated in our IBD cohort, with localization overlapping periostin and TGF-β. This supports the notion that chronic intestinal inflammation induces EMT in epithelial and connective tissue cells, with periostin potentially facilitating this process, as seen in other fibrotic and cancerous tissues. A molecular mechanism potentially driving excessive fibrosis is presented in Figure 8.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35257</offset><text>Our study also examined correlations between markers and clinical parameters. We observed a significant negative correlation between periostin expression and fecal calprotectin, as well as a moderate negative correlation between of TGF-β expression and fecal calprotectin, suggesting that periostin may be particularly elevated during phases of intestinal repair and regeneration when active neutrophilic inflammation is reduced. In addition in CD patients, periostin expression correlated negatively with PCDAI scores, further supporting its association with chronic, profibrotic stages rather than acute inflammation. In experimental acute kidney injury models, periostin has been shown to modulate macrophage behavior, promoting proliferation and polarization toward an M2 phenotype. We propose that a similar mechanism could explain the observed reduction of mononuclear cell infiltrates, the main source of calprotectin overproduction in the intestinal wall.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36224</offset><text>Interestingly, no correlation was observed between periostin expression and PUCAI in UC, indicating potential differences in fibrotic processes and marker expression between IBD subtypes.

Elevated tissue and serum periostin levels have been linked to type 2 inflammatory responses mediated by IL-4 and IL-13, and interventions targeting periostin modulate inflammation in experimental models. Consequently, periostin may serve as a biomarker for fibrotic progression, a predictor of response to anti-inflammatory therapy, and a potential target for novel therapeutics in pediatric IBD. Environmental and lifestyle factors may further influence periostin, TGF-β, and SLUG expression, highlighting the need for future studies to explore these modulatory effects. For instance, periostin is upregulated by Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13), which can be affected by allergen exposure, physical activity, smoking, and diet. These findings suggest that environmental and lifestyle exposures could contribute to interindividual variability in marker expression and the progression of chronic inflammation and fibrosis in IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37563</offset><text>Chronic inflammatory conditions such as IBD are well-established risk factors for colitis-associated colorectal cancer, as persistent inflammation and repeated cycles of injury and repair can promote epithelial DNA damage, dysplasia, and eventual neoplastic transformation over time.

Post hoc power analysis indicated limited sensitivity for periostin and nuclear SLUG expression, suggesting caution in interpreting these results. Nevertheless, large effect sizes support the biological relevance of the findings, and other significant analyses had adequate power (0.70–0.99).

In response to intestinal inflammation, TGF-β expression is upregulated and activates both canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways through the TGF-β receptor. In the canonical pathway, phosphorylated Smad2/3 form a complex with Smad4 that translocates to the nucleus and induces target genes such as SNAI2/SLUG, promoting EMT and periostin production. Non-canonical signaling involves MAPK (ERK1/2, p38, JNK), JAK/STAT, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascades, further enhancing SNAI2/SLUG expression and preventing its degradation via GSK3-β inhibition. Periostin secreted into the ECM binds αvβ3/αvβ5 integrins, activating ILK and establishing a positive feedback loop that reinforces TGF-β signaling, promotes EMT, and contributes to tissue fibrosis.
