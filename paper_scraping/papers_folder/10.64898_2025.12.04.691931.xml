One such condition is autoimmune uveitis, a sight-threatening ocular inflammation driven by retina-specific T cells. Using a model of spontaneous experimental autoimmune uveitis (sEAU) we showed that gut commensals provide innate and adaptive immune stimuli that trigger the disease. Here we report that uveitis-promoting microbes are present in human gut flora and that colonization of germ-free (GF) mice with commensal flora from healthy human donors was sufficient to provoke disease. Severity of sEAU correlated with expansion of Akkermansia and contraction of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)–producing Firmicutes, as well as decreased SCFA levels and a dominant gut Th1 effector response. Mechanistic gain-of-function experiments, enriching GF sEAU mice with Akkermansia, reproduced these microbiome, metabolite and immune phenotype shifts, and exacerbated disease. We propose that Akkermansia promotes autoimmunity by outcompeting SCFA-producers and enhancing Th1-type responses. Notably, an inverse correlation between Akkermansia (Verrucomicrobia) and Firmicutes was also present in fecal microbiome of patients with uveitis, multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease. These findings reveal a stereotypic gut microbial interaction network that regulates systemic immune balance, and may represent an ecologically conserved mechanism through which the gut microbiome modulates autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1581</offset><text>INTRODUCTION</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1594</offset><text>Immune-privileged tissues are increasingly recognized as sites where host–microbiota interactions influence immunological balance in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

Our previous studies highlight the critical role of gut microbiome in triggering sEAU by providing antigenic stimuli that activate retina-specific T cells. Subsequent research reported inhibitory effects of microbiome depletion also in induced EAU, where the antigen is provided, emphasizing the antigen-independent (innate?) effects of gut microbes on EAU.

We did not observe obvious sex differences with respect to disease severity in HuFl mice (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Immune phenotype of colonic CD4+ T cells, based on a range of cell surface and intracellular markers, clearly distinguished HuFl mice from GF and SPF mice (Fig 1d &amp; Extended Data Fig. 1c-e).

Fecal microbiome profiling confirmed successful microbial engraftment and stability of Akkermansia-high or Akk-low status (Fig. 5b &amp; Extended Data Fig. 5a). Akkermansia “spiked” flora induced more severe uveitis than base HuFl alone (Fig. 5c) and the relative abundances of Akkermansia and Firmicutes were consistently inversely correlated (Fig. 5d). Notably, among the major bacterial phyla, Firmicutes was the only phylum whose abundance was decreased in Akk-enriched mice (Fig. 5b &amp; Extended Data Fig. 5b), particularly those taxa considered “professional” SCFA producers such as Clostridia (Extended Data Fig. 5c). To confirm that the effects described above were indeed Akkermansia-specific, we associated GF R161H mice with the same HuFl “spiked” with E. coli. The disease-promoting phenotype and the reduction in Firmicutes abundance were not recapitulated, supporting the notion that the observed effects were specific to Akkermansia (Extended Data Fig. 5d-f).

This reduction was not observed in the E.coli control group (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Given the known immunomodulatory role of SCFAs, we examined whether this metabolomic shift was associated with an altered systemic effector response. In both the Akk-associated minimal flora model and the Akk-enriched HuFl model, reduced serum SCFAs were tightly coupled with elevated serum and/or gut IFN-g responses (Fig. 5f-i).

Unlike SPF gut flora extracts or the cognate peptide antigen, neither Akkermansia preparation activated the retina-specific T cells, as measured by expression of CD69 and Nur77 (Extended Data Fig. 6a-b), indicating that Akkermansia was not acting as an antigen mimic.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17245</offset><text>Single cell RNA-seq analysis of colonic CD4 T cells, of which an average of 15% expressed the R161H TCR, revealed that both R161H TCR-expressing and non-R161H (endogenous) T cells had a Th1, rather than a Th17, signature, that positively correlated with abundance of Akkermansia (Extended Data Fig. 6c-d). Thus, Akkermansia appears to skew the T cell response phenotype independently of the T cell antigen specificity, which for non-R161H cells could be other gut microbes or food antigens. VDJ analysis did not reveal evidence for a 2nd TCR among R161H TCR+ cells. In addition, in silico analysis did not reveal shared sequence(s) between Akkermansia and IRBP161–180, which is the cognate R161H TCR epitope. We interpret this to mean that Akkermansia regulates disease through innate, adjuvant-like mechanisms that shape the T-cell effector response phenotype, as well as indirectly by modulating SCFA-producing Firmicutes.

Application of this metric to the entire cohort of our clinical uveitis samples (so as to minimize any selection bias), revealed higher V/F ratios in uveitis patients compared to healthy subjects (Fig. 6c). We next examined publicly available MS and IBD datasets, the latter comprising patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Compared to healthy controls, the V/F ratio in MS, and in Crohn’s disease patients––a condition predominantly driven by Th1-mediated inflammation––but not in UC patients, was markedly elevated (Fig. 6c). Notably, the ratio of Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes (F/B ratio), commonly used as a broad indicator of “dysbiosis” , has not consistently distinguished patients from healthy controls across disease settings (Fig. 6c).

Specifically, Akkermansia appears to promote sEAU in HuFl R161H mice by outcompeting SCFA-producing Firmicutes in the gut, resulting in diminished SCFA levels and enhanced Th1 responses both locally and systemically (Fig. 6a).

As an example, although Akkermansia promoted Th1 polarization of human PBMCs and positively correlated with disease activity in MS patients, in vivo Th1-polarizing activity was not observed in Akk-monocolonized mice and in the context of a diverse gut microbiome (SPF mice), Akkermansia-specific T cells differentiated into a mixture of effector phenotypes. Our finding that Akkermansia affects sEAU through interactions that modulate the gut microbial network explains and reconciles these contradictions by demonstrating that the immunological impact of Akkermansia—and probably of any single microbe in general—is a product of its interactions with the broader gut microbial community.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21690</offset><text>The R161H sEAU model provides a platform to dissect these contextual effects. When the model was first established, we identified signaling by a (microbiota-dependent) mimic antigen in the SPF flora of R161H mice as an important, but possibly not the only, disease trigger. In the “humanized” sEAU mice, Akkermansia does not appear to act as a surrogate antigen, suggesting that other HuFl members may provide this function. However, we did not attempt to identify the HuFl microbial mimic, as identifying it would lack translational relevance. The R161 TCR recognizes a mouse class II (I-Ar)-restricted epitope of IRBP. Human MHC class II molecules would almost certainly present a different epitope(s) from any given antigen than does mouse I-Ar, plus the epitope(s) would differ between individuals, given the heterogeneity of human MHC haplotypes. Moreover, whereas IRBP is a dominant retinal autoantigen in mice, human uveitis more commonly involves recall responses to arrestin. Therefore, although the HuFl R161H sEAU model cannot reveal specific antigenic targets involved in human uveitis, it can reveal conserved mechanisms shared across species, such as the microbial interaction network identified in this study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22919</offset><text>A key feature of this microbial network is the negative relationship between Akkermansia and Firmicutes, which links gut microbial composition to systemic inflammation.

Akkermansia promotes mucus degradation during gut inflammation. The compromised mucus barrier would exacerbate inflammation and oxidative stress, creating inhospitable conditions for obligate anaerobes like Firmicutes.

We propose that the V/F ratio is more specifically informative in autoimmune and inflammatory settings. Of note, numerous studies report an association between uveitic diseases and gut inflammation. Uveitis is associated with an increased risk of Crohn’s (but not of UC), and Crohn’s patients are more likely than UC patients to develop uveitis. The findings are compatible with the notion that the V/F ratio increases under conditions where gut inflammation co-occurs with extraintestinal autoimmunity. The V/F ratio may also rise under Th1-dominant inflammatory conditions, as observed in our data.

Emerging approaches such as bacterial spatial transcriptomics are not yet sufficiently developed to define the precise mechanisms by which Akkermansia antagonizes SCFA-producing Firmicutes. In addition, the finite capacity of our GF R161H colony constrains the scale and breadth of gnotobiotic experiments. Consequently, several mechanistic studies, including administering individual SCFAs to HuFl mice for functional validation, could not be completed within a feasible time frame.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25520</offset><text>In conclusion, our findings show that a complex microbial interaction network—rather than individual taxa—plays a central role in shaping the gut–eye axis. The Akkermansia–Firmicutes relationship, captured in a simple translational metric (the V/F ratio) that tracks inflammatory state and immune polarization, likely reflects a generalizable ecological principle in which microbial competition influences systemic immune balance and susceptibility to autoimmunity and inflammation, and which extends across species. Future studies aimed at defining the mechanisms by which Akkermansia gains an advantage over SCFA-producing Firmicutes, may guide the development of microbiome-based interventions for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases that intersect with gut dysregulation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>26305</offset><text>METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>26313</offset><text>Mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26319</offset><text>R161H mice on the B10.RIII background were bred in-house and maintained under SPF conditions and fed standard facility chow ad libitum.
