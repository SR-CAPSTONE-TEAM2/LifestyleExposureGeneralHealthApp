Therapeutic goals in UC have moved from symptom control to more stringent outcomes such as endoscopic and histologic remission, which have been observed to correlate with improved long-term outcomes. Disease clearance, a composite endpoint simultaneously including clinical remission, endoscopic and histologic healing, has been recently proposed as the ultimate target. A treat-to-target approach, as endorsed by the STRIDE II consensus, with a tight monitoring and treatment escalation when predefined endpoints are not reached, is proposed as a strategy to achieve complete disease control. However, unlike Crohn’s disease (CD), the evidence supporting this approach for the management of UC is limited and its implementation in routine clinical practice is not widely diffused. Recent real-life data show that almost half of UC patients are not adequately controlled with current therapies according to STRIDE II criteria, due to steroid overuse, persistent signs of inflammation, active extra-intestinal manifestations and impaired quality of life. This perspective paper explores current evidence and future directions on treat-to-target strategies in UC for clinical research and practice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1445</offset><text>1.

In both groups, patients were re-evaluated every 12 weeks using the Harvey–Bradshaw Index (HBI), and treatment was escalated in the absence of clinical remission (HBI ≥ 4). The study included CD patients naïve to advanced therapies, balanced for demographic and disease characteristics, with 1084 enrolled in the ECI arm and 898 in the conventional management group.

Importantly, no significant differences in safety profiles were observed between the two groups. Moreover, patients achieving deep remission-defined as endoscopic remission with no steroid use for more than 8 weeks- have a lower risk of long-term disease progression (defined as development of new internal fistulas or abscesses, strictures, perianal fistulas or abscesses, or the need for hospitalization or surgery for CD).

First, UC has historically been viewed as a disease with more easily assessable activity, in which clinical symptoms often show a closer correlation with mucosal inflammation. This perception may have reduced the perceived need for rigorous, objective monitoring strategies. In addition, the natural history of UC—characterized by continuous inflammation confined to the colon—has traditionally favored step-up therapeutic approaches, thereby delaying the widespread adoption of early intensive treatment strategies. By contrast, CD is defined by transmural inflammation, progressive structural damage, and a higher risk of irreversible complications, features that have promoted earlier acceptance of proactive treat-to-target paradigms. Finally, from a methodological perspective, many UC clinical trials have prioritized short-term clinical and endoscopic outcomes rather than long-term disease-modifying endpoints.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20997</offset><text>In 2014, Osterman et al. conducted an open-label, randomized trial involving 52 patients with UC who were in clinical remission on mesalamine 2.4 g/day but had elevated FCP (≥50 µg/g). Participants were randomized 1:1 to either continue the same dose or escalate to 4.8 g/day. The primary endpoint (FCP &lt; 50 µg/g without relapse at 6 weeks) was achieved by a significantly greater proportion of patients in the dose-escalation group compared with the stable-dose group (26.9% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.049). Additionally, a nearly significant greater reduction in median FCP levels, adjusted for baseline values, was observed with dose escalation (−70 µg/g [IQR −378 to 4] vs. −11 µg/g [IQR −231 to 101], p = 0.06). Interestingly, there was no difference between the two groups in time to clinical relapse over 48 weeks. However, among patients in remission at week 12, those with FCP ≥ 200 µg/g experienced a significantly shorter time to clinical relapse than those with FCP &lt; 200 µg/g (p = 0.01), with a similar trend for FCP ≥ 100 vs. &lt; 100 µg/g (p = 0.09).

Patients with UC in clinical remission on low-dose aminosalicylates but with at least one flare during the previous year were randomized (3:2) to a T2T arm (wherein mesalamine dose was optimized if monthly FCP exceeded 300 µg/g; n = 51) or a control group without FCP-guided optimization (n = 40). Although the overall proportion of patients experiencing at least one relapse during the 18-month follow-up was numerically lower in the T2T group (35.3% vs. 50.0%, p = 0.23), this difference was not statistically significant. Notably, most relapses in the T2T arm (10 of 18) occurred in patients without preceding FCP elevation and thus without dose escalation. When comparing only those who underwent dose escalation in the T2T group with control patients who had FCP &gt; 300 µg/g, a significantly lower relapse rate was observed in the intervention group (28.6% vs. 57.1%, p &lt; 0.05). Collectively, these findings support the rationale for FCP-guided T2T optimization of mesalamine in UC, while also emphasizing the need to define optimal FCP thresholds for intervention. The ongoing VERDICT trial represents the first randomized controlled trial designed to assess T2T management with biologics in UC. Patients with moderate-to-severe UC initiating Vedolizumab are randomized (2:3:5) to three strategies differing by their predefined treatment targets: (1) group 1: treat to symptoms (steroid-free clinical remission, SFCR); (2) group 2: treat to symptoms and endoscopy (SFCR + MES ≤ 1); (3) group 3: treat to symptoms, endoscopy and histology (SFCR + MES ≤ Geboes score &lt; 2.0, that is disease clearance).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23979</offset><text>Patients are evaluated every 16 weeks (receiving clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, and histologic assessments), with Vedolizumab dose escalation permitted at weeks 16 and 32 if their assigned target is not achieved; by week 48, patients not meeting their target are managed at the investigator’s discretion.

In transgenic mice with constitutive TL1A expression in lymphoid or myeloid cells, increased collagen deposition and gut fibrosis were observed, accompanied by heightened activation of mucosal T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Notably, blockade of TL1A with neutralizing antibodies reversed established colonic fibrosis and reduced the expression of profibrotic mediators such as connective tissue growth factor, TGF-β1, IL31Ra, and IGF-1, as well as decreasing fibroblast and myofibroblast numbers. Primary intestinal myofibroblasts express DR3 and respond to TL1A stimulation by upregulating collagen and IL31Ra, directly linking this pathway to extracellular matrix production. TL1A also promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition through TGF-β1/Smad3, IL-13, and transcription factors such as ZEB1 and Snail1.

Importantly, abdominal pain often persists despite treat-to-target–driven escalation of immunomodulatory therapy and the achievement of conventional therapeutic goals, such as endoscopic remission. Although chronic opioid use is still common for symptom control, it is associated with substantial adverse effects and increased mortality and should therefore be avoided.
