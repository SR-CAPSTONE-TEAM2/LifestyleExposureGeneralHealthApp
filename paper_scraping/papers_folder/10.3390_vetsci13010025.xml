The Nrf2 signaling pathway serves as a master regulator of cellular antioxidant defenses and a key therapeutic target for intestinal inflammatory disorders, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. The interplay between oxidative stress, Nrf2 signaling, and NF-κB inflammatory cascades represents a critical axis in the pathogenesis and resolution of intestinal inflammation. Under normal physiological conditions, Nrf2 remains sequestered in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which facilitates its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. However, during oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and electrophilic compounds modify critical cysteine residues on Keap1, disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and enabling Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of genes encoding phase II detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant proteins, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase. This comprehensive review synthesizes current evidence demonstrating that activation of Nrf2 signaling confers protection against intestinal inflammation through multiple interconnected mechanisms: suppression of NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory cascades, enhancement of cellular antioxidant capacity, restoration of intestinal barrier integrity, modulation of immune cell function, and favorable alteration of gut microbiota composition. We systematically examine a diverse array of therapeutic agents targeting Nrf2 signaling, including bioactive peptides, natural polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, probiotics, and synthetic compounds. The mechanistic insights and therapeutic evidence presented underscore the translational potential of Nrf2 pathway modulation as a multi-targeted strategy for managing intestinal inflammatory conditions and restoring mucosal homeostasis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>3051</offset><text>1.

These conditions impose a substantial burden on healthcare systems and significantly diminish patients’ quality of life through persistent symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and systemic complications. The pathogenesis of IBD is multifactorial, involving complex interactions between genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, dysregulated immune responses, and impaired mucosal barrier function. A hallmark feature of IBD is the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and sustained oxidative stress within the intestinal mucosa, which perpetuates tissue damage, amplifies inflammatory cascades, and compromises epithelial barrier integrity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4045</offset><text>The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) serves as the master transcriptional regulator orchestrating cellular antioxidant and cytoprotective responses. Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 activity is tightly regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which promotes Nrf2 degradation to maintain low basal expression of antioxidant genes. Upon exposure to oxidative stress or electrophilic compounds, Nrf2 stabilizes and translocates to the nucleus, activating transcription of phase II detoxifying enzymes, antioxidant proteins (heme oxygenase-1, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase), glutathione biosynthesis enzymes, and numerous other cytoprotective mediators. In intestinal epithelium, Nrf2 activation enhances barrier function, promotes epithelial regeneration, modulates immune responses, and influences microbiota composition, thereby protecting against oxidative damage and inflammation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4989</offset><text>The therapeutic potential of Nrf2 pathway modulation in intestinal health has gained considerable attention in recent years. Accumulating evidence from preclinical studies demonstrates that pharmacological activation of Nrf2 signaling through diverse natural products, synthetic compounds, and dietary interventions can ameliorate experimental colitis, reduce intestinal inflammation, restore barrier integrity, and modulate gut microbiota composition. These beneficial effects are mediated through multiple interconnected mechanisms, including enhanced antioxidant capacity, suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades [particularly the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway], inhibition of inflammasome activation, modulation of immune cell function, promotion of intestinal stem cell activity, and favorable alteration of microbial ecology. The cross-talk between Nrf2 and NF-κB pathways represents a particularly important regulatory axis, as activation of Nrf2 can suppress NF-κB-driven inflammatory gene expression through multiple mechanisms, including direct protein–protein interactions, competition for transcriptional co-activators, and indirect effects mediated by Nrf2-induced antioxidant proteins that reduce ROS-dependent NF-κB activation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6268</offset><text>These mechanisms underpin their ability to improve gut morphology, modulate microbiota, enhance immune function, and alleviate stress-induced intestinal damage, thereby improving growth performance. Despite these promising physiological and performance-related benefits, current evidence remains limited and heterogeneous across different species and experimental conditions. While their potential in animal husbandry is promising, future research must address gaps in comparative efficacy, synergistic effects, and long-term safety to enable practical applications. This comprehensive review aims to synthesize current understanding of Nrf2 signaling in intestinal health, with particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of Nrf2 activation against intestinal inflammation. We systematically examine the intricate interplay between oxidative stress, Nrf2 signaling, and NF-κB inflammatory cascades in the pathogenesis and resolution of intestinal inflammation. With a focus on translational applications across veterinary and clinical settings, we provide a detailed analysis of diverse therapeutic agents that target Nrf2 signaling to ameliorate intestinal inflammatory conditions, including natural bioactive compounds, probiotics, dietary interventions, and synthetic molecules.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>7593</offset><text>2.

This oxidative burden overwhelms endogenous antioxidant defenses, manifesting as elevated lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal), protein carbonylation, oxidized glutathione ratios, and DNA oxidation markers (8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine). The resulting redox dysregulation perpetuates mucosal injury through multiple mechanisms. Oxidative modification of membrane phospholipids compromises epithelial barrier integrity through tight junction protein degradation (occludin, claudins, ZO-1) and cytoskeletal disruption, facilitating paracellular permeability and bacterial translocation. ROS function as critical second messengers activating redox-sensitive transcription factors, particularly NF-κB, through IκB kinase phosphorylation and subsequent IκBα degradation, thereby amplifying pro-inflammatory gene expression and cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9954</offset><text>3.2. Nrf2-Keap1 Regulatory Architecture</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9994</offset><text>The Keap1-Nrf2 axis functions as a molecular rheostat governing cellular redox homeostasis and cytoprotective responses. Under homeostatic conditions, Keap1 homodimers sequester Nrf2 in the cytoplasm through BTB (broad complex, tramtrack, bric-à-brac) domain-mediated association with the Cullin 3-Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This molecular architecture maintains constitutive Nrf2 ubiquitination and rapid proteasomal turnover, ensuring low basal expression of ARE-dependent genes. Keap1 contains multiple reactive cysteine residues (Cys151, Cys273, Cys288) functioning as electrophile sensors that undergo post-translational modifications (oxidation, alkylation, nitrosylation) upon encountering oxidative or electrophilic stressors. These modifications disrupt the hinge-and-latch mechanism between Keap1’s double glycine repeat (DGR) domain and Nrf2’s Neh2 domain, stabilizing Nrf2 and promoting nuclear accumulation. Nuclear Nrf2 heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins (MafF, MafG, MafK) and binds antioxidant response elements (ARE) in promoter regions, recruiting transcriptional co-activators (CBP/p300) to orchestrate expression of &gt;200 cytoprotective genes encoding phase II detoxifying enzymes (NQO1, GSTs, UGTs), antioxidant proteins (HO-1, GCLC/M, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxins), and metabolic regulators.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11323</offset><text>3.3.

ROS serve as obligate second messengers driving NF-κB activation through oxidative modification of pathway components, including IκB kinase complex phosphorylation and IκBα degradation. Conversely, Nrf2-mediated induction of antioxidant enzymes attenuates ROS-dependent NF-κB activation, creating a negative feedback loop. Direct protein–protein interactions provide additional regulatory complexity: Keap1 associates with IKKβ modulating its activity, while Nrf2 physically interacts with p65/RelA, either sequestering it in the cytoplasm or competing for limiting transcriptional co-activators (CBP/p300) in the nucleus. Temporal dynamics distinguish these pathways: NF-κB exhibits rapid, transient activation kinetics (minutes) suited for immediate inflammatory responses, whereas Nrf2 demonstrates delayed but sustained activation (hours) appropriate for establishing adaptive cytoprotection.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12481</offset><text>In experimental colitis models, Nrf2−/− mice display heightened disease severity with exacerbated histological damage, increased NF-κB activity, and elevated inflammatory cytokine expression. Pharmacological Nrf2 activation confers protection through multi-modal mechanisms: enhanced antioxidant capacity, attenuated pro-inflammatory signaling, preserved epithelial barrier function via tight junction protein upregulation, favorable modulation of immune cell phenotypes (M2 macrophage polarization, regulatory T cell expansion), and beneficial microbiota compositional shifts. These integrated effects collectively restore intestinal homeostasis and promote mucosal healing in inflammatory conditions. The mechanisms by which oxidative stress and various environmental, dietary, and pathological agents trigger intestinal diseases are summarized in Figure 1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>13346</offset><text>4.

Importantly, these compounds have demonstrated efficacy across multiple experimental platforms, including rodent colitis models, porcine and avian livestock systems, and human intestinal cell lines, supporting their translational relevance for both agricultural applications and human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapeutics.

In DSS models, it activates Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, enhancing transepithelial electrical resistance and upregulating tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin. Resveratrol simultaneously suppresses NF-κB p65 translocation while activating Nrf2/HO-1, addressing both oxidative and inflammatory injury components in zearalenone-induced damage. Network pharmacology confirms its effects operate primarily through Nrf2-dependent oxidative stress modulation. Notably, resveratrol counteracts ferroptosis through Nrf2/FTH1/GPX4 axis activation in exercise-induced intestinal damage, positioning it as a prototype for understanding multi-pathway protection through upstream Nrf2 activation. Collectively, stilbenoids, particularly resveratrol, represent well-characterized Nrf2 activators with robust preclinical evidence supporting their development as therapeutic agents for oxidative stress-related intestinal pathologies in both veterinary and human medicine.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>15376</offset><text>4.1.2.

Ellagic acid exhibits bidirectional microbiota interactions, with intestinal biotransformation into bioavailable urolithin metabolites that activate Nrf2 while inhibiting NF-κB. Ellagic acid also modulates microbiome composition, reducing oxidative stress via Nrf2/ROS/ NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) axis, and mitigates paraquat-induced stress through Nrf2 translocation and HO-1/NQO1 upregulation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16171</offset><text>Paralleling these mechanistic insights, chlorogenic acid exemplifies dual-pathway regulation, inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB while activating Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses. In piglets, supplementation elevated systemic antioxidant capacity and modulated ileal microbiota. Its protective effects extend to the gut–brain axis, protecting against sleep deprivation-induced cognitive deficits through Nrf2/PPAR activation while enhancing barrier function. The phenolic acid family demonstrates consistent dose-dependent Nrf2/HO-1 activation: ferulic and quinic acids reduce inflammation in acetic acid-induced colitis, while coumaric and syringic acids alleviate colitis with significant TNF-α and IL-1β reductions. Tannic acid engages the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 pathway while inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB-NLRP3 signaling against ETEC K88-induced diarrhea, suggesting autophagy-dependent Nrf2 activation mechanisms. Taken together, phenolic acids constitute a versatile class of Nrf2 activators whose microbiota-mediated biotransformation and dual antioxidant-anti-inflammatory actions establish them as promising candidates for translational development across agricultural and clinical settings.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>17362</offset><text>4.1.3.

For example, Esculetin exhibits antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhimurium through downregulation of the T3SS-1 virulence system, preventing bacterial invasion of intestinal cells, and in infected mice, esculetin ameliorated cecal injury and corrected microbial dysbiosis through Nrf2 pathway activation. This dual antimicrobial and cytoprotective mechanism is complemented by scopoletin, which demonstrates the characteristic dual-pathway mechanism by suppressing NF-κB while activating Nrf2 to upregulate HO-1 and NQO1, with restoration of tight junction proteins confirming barrier-protective effects. The dual antimicrobial-cytoprotective properties of coumarins position them as particularly valuable therapeutic candidates in the context of rising antimicrobial resistance. Their ability to simultaneously target bacterial virulence mechanisms and reinforce host intestinal defenses through Nrf2 activation represents a novel therapeutic strategy applicable to both food animal production—where reducing antibiotic usage is a priority—and human gastrointestinal infections complicated by dysbiosis. Thus, coumarins represent a distinct subclass of phenolic compounds whose combined antimicrobial and Nrf2-activating properties offer unique advantages for managing infectious enteritis across species.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>18801</offset><text>4.1.4.

Quercetin provides compelling Nrf2-dependent barrier protection, with effects requiring Nrf2 expression. Dose-dependent activation reverses DON-induced claudin-4 reduction, completely blocked by brusatol.

These agents, including polysaccharides, peptides, probiotics, and short-chain fatty acids, often function through unique mechanisms involving gut microbiota-mediated biotransformation. Critically, these compounds are particularly amenable to dietary supplementation strategies in both livestock production and human nutrition, facilitating their practical implementation across diverse settings. The evidence for these diverse Nrf2-targeting nutrients and microbial agents is consolidated in Table 2, and their mechanisms are shown in Figure 2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>27370</offset><text>4.2.1. Polysaccharides</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27393</offset><text>Complex polysaccharides demonstrate Nrf2-activating mechanisms involving gut microbiota-mediated biotransformation and prebiotic effects. For example, brown algae polysaccharides (BAPs) alleviate oxidative stress through Nrf2/ARE activation, increasing nuclear Nrf2 translocation and upregulating HO-1, SOD, and CAT. Epimedium polysaccharide alleviates UC by activating Keap1/Nrf2 while promoting protective autophagy via AMPK/mTOR, with Nrf2-dependent efficacy demonstrated in knockout mice. Efficacy was demonstrated to be Nrf2-dependent using knockout mice, establishing the hierarchy of pathway activation. Similarly, Artemisia annua polysaccharide improves growth performance in E. coli-challenged broilers while enhancing antioxidant capacity through Nrf2 activation and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB inhibition. Furthermore, Mussel polysaccharide activates Nrf2-Keap1 pathway with HO-1 and antioxidant enzyme upregulation, protecting against cyclophosphamide-induced oxidative injury.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28376</offset><text>Extending beyond direct Nrf2 activation, Lycium barbarum polysaccharides activate Nrf2 signaling while enriching beneficial microbiota (Ruminococcaceae, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia) and enhancing short-chain fatty acid production. Paralleling this integrated approach, polysaccharide suppresses NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome while activating Nrf2/HO-1 and mediating anti-ferroptosis effects. Additional mechanistically characterized compounds include Melientha longistaminea polysaccharide, Floccularia luteovirens polysaccharide, Artemisia capillaris polysaccharide, yeast β-glucan (activating both Nrf2 and AHR), and Camellia oleifera polysaccharide as shown in Table 2. Accordingly, polysaccharides represent multifunctional Nrf2 activators whose combined antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and prebiotic properties position them as ideal candidates for dietary-based intestinal health interventions across species.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>29297</offset><text>4.2.2. Peptides and Amino Acids</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29329</offset><text>Bioactive peptides provide intestinal protection through Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses combined with immunomodulation. Peptide-induced Nrf2 activation upregulates antioxidant enzymes, reducing ROS and subsequently inhibiting ROS-sensitive NF-κB. For example, activates Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, with LC-MS identifying four specific bioactive sequences. Complementing these findings, rice protein peptides have been found to ctivate Keap1-Nrf2 signaling while modulating gut microbiota, increasing Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and promoting beneficial bacteria.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29896</offset><text>In addition to bioactive peptides, individual amino acids also demonstrate Nrf2-activating capacity beyond nutritional roles. For example, proline upregulates Nrf2/HO-1, suppressing NF-κB p65 phosphorylation to alleviate hibernation-induced barrier dysfunction. While, taurine produces dose-dependent improvements in antioxidant status through enhanced Nrf2, HO-1, GPX1, and SOD1 expression, with optimal doses (0.3–0.4%) favorably modulating gut microbiota. In addition, L-theanine has been shown to promote Nrf2 nuclear translocation while decreasing Keap1, with ML385 completely abolishing protection. Extending this mechanistic diversity, glutamine prevents 5-FU-induced mucositis by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB while activating Nrf2/HO-1 and increasing mTOR, with concurrent microbial diversity enhancement. Furthermore, betaine activates Nrf2/Keap1 while inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB/MAPK, with effects transmissible through maternal supplementation, demonstrating transgenerational protective mechanisms. From a practical standpoint, amino acids and bioactive peptides constitute an immediately translatable class of Nrf2 activators, with established clinical and agricultural applications that can be enhanced through mechanistic understanding of their Nrf2-dependent protective actions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>31191</offset><text>4.2.3.

Similarly, Deer oil suppresses NF-κB phosphorylation while upregulating Nrf2/HO-1, with parallel microbiota modulation increasing Odoribacter, Blautia, and short-chain fatty acids. Moreover, Coix seed oil activates Keap1/Nrf2 in kidney while reinforcing intestinal barrier integrity through tight junction upregulation. Expanding this therapeutic repertoire, α-Lipoic acid activates Keap1-Nrf2 while inhibiting both ferroptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, icosapent ethyl activates SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 and PI3K/Akt signaling while suppressing NF-κB, with benefits abolished by SIRT1 inhibition. Hence, dietary lipids represent an accessible class of Nrf2 activators whose protective intestinal effects complement their established systemic health benefits, supporting integrated dietary strategies for gut-systemic health optimization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>32284</offset><text>4.2.4. Organic Acids</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32305</offset><text>Simple organic acids demonstrate Nrf2-activating capacity useful in feed additives and functional foods. Glyceryl lactate combined with lactic acid activates Nrf2 while modulating cecal microbiota to increase SCFA-producing bacteria, proving most effective in combination. Building on this synergistic principle, encapsulated benzoic acid outperforms unencapsulated forms in suppressing TLR4/NF-κB and activating NRF2, with NRF2 inhibition abolishing benefits. Complementing these findings, itaconic acid activates Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 while reversing gut dysbiosis induced by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure, reducing harmful bacteria while promoting Lactobacillus. Notably, organic acids offer practical, cost-effective Nrf2 activation strategies particularly suited to large-scale livestock production, with potential extension to human functional food development.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>33180</offset><text>4.2.5. Probiotics</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33198</offset><text>Probiotic organisms activate Nrf2 through microbial metabolite production, pattern recognition receptor engagement, or direct host cell interaction. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron increases tryptophan metabolites including indole, enhancing barrier integrity and reducing inflammation via AHR-Nrf2 signaling. Building on this framework, Lactobacillus acidophilus activates p62-Keap1-Nrf2 pathway while increasing Akkermansia and restoring short-chain fatty acids. Similarly, Clostridium dalinum inhibits NF-κB while activating Keap1-Nrf2-ARE, with metabolomics identifying elevated anti-inflammatory metabolites and butanoate metabolism activation. Expanding this mechanistic repertoire, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei CCFM1222 inhibits TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB while activating Nrf2, elevating antioxidant enzymes and shifting microbiota. Moreover, Clostridium butyricum enhances intestinal health by activating Nrf2 and suppressing NF-κB while improving digestive enzyme activity, whereas Bacillus amyloliquefaciens mediates protection through Keap1/Nrf2 signaling, increasing Nrf2 while decreasing Keap1. As such, probiotics exemplify the successful integration of Nrf2-targeting strategies with microbiome modulation, offering established therapeutic platforms for continued development in both veterinary and human intestinal health applications.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>34550</offset><text>4.2.6. Microbial Metabolites</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34579</offset><text>Microbiota-derived metabolites represent an emerging therapeutic class mediating many probiotic and prebiotic effects. Indole-3-lactic acid, produced by Lactiplantibacillus plantarum DPUL-S164 from tryptophan metabolism, strengthens intestinal barrier via coordinated AhR and Nrf2 activation, with both dependent on AhR expression. Paralleling these findings, sodium butyrate alleviates DSS-induced colitis by activating COX-2/Nrf2/HO-1 while suppressing NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome and promoting mitophagy via Pink1/Parkin. Furthermore, butyric acid upregulates Nrf2 in vitro, with fecal microbiota transplantation from treated mice replicating therapeutic effects and Nrf2 activation, demonstrating that microbiota-derived butyrate is sufficient to activate host Nrf2 with functional consequences. Consequently, microbial metabolites constitute an emerging class of Nrf2 activators that bridge dietary, microbiome, and pharmaceutical intervention strategies, offering precise molecular tools for modulating intestinal oxidative stress responses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">vetsci-13-00025-t002.xml</infon><infon key="id">vetsci-13-00025-t002</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>35628</offset><text>Bioactive nutrients and microbial agents targeting Nrf2 for intestinal health.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">vetsci-13-00025-t002.xml</infon><infon key="id">vetsci-13-00025-t002</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

These compounds often exhibit high-affinity interactions with the Keap1-Nrf2 complex and engage in sophisticated multi-pathway regulation. Notably, many of these agents derive from traditional medicine systems with centuries of empirical validation in treating gastrointestinal disorders, providing a strong rationale for their contemporary mechanistic investigation and clinical development. The broad spectrum of these plant-derived therapeutics and their documented efficacy in experimental models of intestinal inflammation are cataloged in Table 3.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>39578</offset><text>4.3.1. Terpenoids</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>39596</offset><text>Terpenoids demonstrate Nrf2-activating mechanisms often involving direct protein-target interactions amenable to structural characterization. Cardamonin functions through hierarchical AhR activation that subsequently promotes Nrf2 nuclear translocation and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, with both CH223191 (AhR inhibitor) and ML385 (Nrf2 inhibitor) abolishing anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, efficacy extends to heat stress conditions, activating Nrf2 components (Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1) while modulating gut microbiota. Building upon these hierarchical activation mechanisms, neferine competitively binds Keap1 at Cys-288, promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activating Nrf2/FPN and Nrf2/xCT/GPX4 axes. This dual-axis activation inhibits ferroptosis in severe acute pancreatitis, with effects reversed by ML385 and erastin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40426</offset><text>Extending beyond single-pathway modulation, α-mangostin activates Nrf2/HO-1 while suppressing NF-κB/NLRP3/caspase-1, reducing oxidative stress and promoting autophagy. Treatment remodeled gut microbiota, increasing Ligilactobacillus and Muribaculum that correlated with elevated propionic and butyric acid. Similarly, sclareol activates Nrf2 while inhibiting NF-κB/MLCK pathway, preserving tight junctions and reducing inflammation and bacterial translocation. Furthermore, limonin demonstrates direct Nrf2/ARE interaction via molecular docking, with ML385 reversing protection against NSAID-induced injury. Complementing these findings, oleanolic acid 28-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (OAG) alleviates UC by inhibiting ferroptosis through Nrf2/x-CT/GPX4. Multi-omics analysis confirmed OAG directly binds and modulates GPX4, NRF2, HO-1, and x-CT. Additional terpenoids include panaxadiol (inhibiting MAPK/NF-κB while activating AMPK/NRF2/NQO1), columbianadin (potentiating Nrf2 while suppressing TLR4/NF-κB), and melianodiol (activating Nrf2 while suppressing JAK/STAT and NF-κB). Together, these data indicate that terpenoids represent a structurally diverse class of Nrf2 activators whose well-defined molecular interactions facilitate rational drug design and clinical translation for intestinal inflammatory disorders.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>41769</offset><text>4.3.2. Alkaloids</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41786</offset><text>Alkaloids demonstrate potent Nrf2-activating capacity with well-characterized molecular mechanisms. Berberine produces marked Nfe2l2 upregulation with enhanced SOD, CAT, GPx, and GR activities in experimental colitis. In ETEC-infected piglets, berberine downregulates TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB while upregulating Nrf2, optimizing gut microbiota by increasing beneficial bacteria. Notably, berberine also regulates gut microbiota-associated tryptophan metabolites through AhR activation, restoring gut barrier function through this microbiota-metabolite-receptor axis. Complementing these findings, sinomenine activates Nrf2/HO-1 while suppressing NF-κB to reduce TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. It modulates cell death processes (necroptosis, pyroptosis) and remodels gut microbiota by correcting Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes imbalances. Similarly, cepharanthine activates AMPK-α1/AKT/GSK-3β signaling, driving NRF2-dependent antioxidant genes (HO-1, NQO-1) while inhibiting MAPK and NF-κB p65. Effects were entirely abrogated in NRF2-knockout mice. Isoquinoline alkaloids from Macleaya cordata co-regulate TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and Nrf2 pathways, restoring gut microbiota and barrier integrity. Oxyberberine, a microbiota-derived berberine metabolite with superior efficacy, activates Keap1/Nrf2 by promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation while suppressing NF-κB through IκBα phosphorylation inhibition. Additional alkaloids include dictamnine (activating Nrf2-Gpx4 to inhibit ferroptosis), corynoline (with ML385-abolished protection), and cinnamaldehyde (activating PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 to restore barrier integrity). Based on these findings, alkaloids constitute potent, clinically validated Nrf2 activators with established safety profiles and regulatory precedent, positioning them as leading candidates for continued therapeutic development in intestinal inflammatory disorders.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>43682</offset><text>4.3.3. Plant Extracts</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43704</offset><text>Complex plant extracts demonstrate therapeutic effects potentially through synergistic multi-target engagement or enhanced bioavailability. For instance, Hericium erinaceus extract activates Nrf2 and upregulates HO-1 while enhancing microbiome diversity, providing gastroprotection against ethanol-induced and acetic acid-induced injury. Similarly, Rosa roxburghii fermentation broths activate Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 through Nrf2 nuclear translocation, attenuating pulmonary fibrosis while modulating gut microbiota. Correlation analysis linked microbial changes (reduced Proteus, increased Ileibacterium and Dubosiella) to oxidative stress inhibition. In a comparable manner, Glycine tabacina ethanol extract suppresses NF-κB and MAPK/JNK while activating Nrf2, coordinately reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, Viola yedoensis Makino inhibits NF-κB/NLRP3 while activating Nrf2/MAPK, reducing mitochondrial damage and apoptosis while modulating microbiota. Correspondingly, Forsythia suspensa extract activates Nrf2-NLRP3 coordination, with Nrf2 silencing abolishing anti-pyroptotic effects. Metabolomic analysis revealed reversal of colitis-associated dysfunction in glutathione metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and linoleic acid metabolism. Additional plant extracts with characterized Nrf2-mediated protection include Aurantii Fructus extract (activating Nrf2/HO-1 while suppressing NF-κB and restoring microbiota), Mesua Assamica extract (suppressing NF-κB/STAT3 while activating HO-1/Nrf2/SIRT1), apple polyphenols (exhibiting Nrf2-dependent barrier protection reduced by ML385), grape seed anthocyanins encapsulated in chitosan-phytic acid gel (inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB while activating Nrf2), and maggot extracts (increasing Nrf2 while preventing Keap1-mediated degradation, abolished by ML385). Therefore, plant extracts represent pragmatic Nrf2-targeting interventions whose multi-component nature may confer therapeutic advantages through synergistic pathway modulation, supporting their development as functional foods and nutraceuticals for intestinal health.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>45856</offset><text>4.3.4.

Lizhong decoction (LZD) alleviates UC by inhibiting ferroptosis through Nrf2 activation, upregulating SLC7A11 and GPX4 while suppressing oxidative stress and iron overload. Building upon these observations, licorice and its principal active component glycyrrhetinic acid activate Nrf2/PINK1 to regulate mitophagy, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress while repairing mitochondrial damage and enhancing barrier proteins. Gene silencing abolished protective effects. Similarly, Gegen Qinlian decoction (GQ) activates Nrf2/ARE to combat oxidative stress, with puerarin, berberine, and liquiritin identified as primary drivers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46643</offset><text>Certain formulations achieve effects through microbiota-mediated mechanisms converging on Nrf2 signaling. In contrast to the direct pathway activation described above, Yinchen Linggui Zhugan decoction modifies gut microbiota to enrich SCFA-producing bacteria and elevate butyric acid, which subsequently activates hepatic SIRT1/Nrf2 to upregulate HO-1 and NQO1. Ginseng root extract (GRE) suppresses MAPK/NF-κB while activating p62-Nrf2-Keap1 axis to enhance antioxidant defense and mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction. GRE also induces cytoprotective autophagy via Akt-mTOR pathway. Ultimately, traditional herbal formulas represent a rich source of validated Nrf2-targeting therapeutics whose integration of empirical clinical evidence with contemporary molecular mechanistic understanding offers a robust foundation for evidence-based application in modern intestinal disease management.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">vetsci-13-00025-t003.xml</infon><infon key="id">vetsci-13-00025-t003</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>47537</offset><text>Terpenoids, alkaloids, plant extracts and traditional medicines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">vetsci-13-00025-t003.xml</infon><infon key="id">vetsci-13-00025-t003</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

Therapeutic Potential and Translational Outlook</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>51051</offset><text>The extensive body of evidence reviewed in this section establishes the Nrf2 signaling pathway as a validated therapeutic target for intestinal inflammatory disorders across multiple compound classes and experimental platforms. Across structurally diverse compound classes—ranging from phenolics and terpenoids to microbial metabolites—convergent protective mechanisms have been consistently observed, including antioxidant enzyme induction, NF-κB suppression, ferroptosis inhibition, and gut microbiota modulation. This mechanistic convergence underscores the fundamental role of Nrf2 signaling in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and highlights its therapeutic relevance across multiple disease contexts. The demonstrated efficacy in rodent disease models, livestock production systems, and human intestinal cell lines collectively establishes a robust preclinical foundation for clinical development, while concurrent agricultural applications present viable alternatives to antimicrobial growth promoters with attendant benefits for animal welfare and food safety.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>52127</offset><text>Among the phenolic compounds, resveratrol and phenolic acids occupy a distinctive translational niche owing to their abundance in common dietary sources and well-established safety profiles. Their efficacy in weaned piglet models, which closely approximate human intestinal physiology, supports dual applications as livestock feed additives and nutraceutical interventions for inflammatory bowel disease management. Flavonoids, particularly quercetin and curcumin, exhibit exceptional translational potential through extensive validation across DSS-induced murine colitis, deoxynivalenol-challenged livestock, and human intestinal cell lines, with both compounds having advanced to human clinical trials as adjunctive therapies. Curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate represent the most clinically mature Nrf2 activators, demonstrating efficacy in multiple human ulcerative colitis trials while advanced delivery systems, including nanoparticles and liposomes, have successfully addressed historical bioavailability limitations. The emerging recognition of anti-ferroptotic mechanisms further expands their therapeutic scope to encompass chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis, thereby addressing a significant unmet clinical need.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>53361</offset><text>Endogenous and dietary metabolites demonstrate similarly robust translational applicability. Amino acids and bioactive peptides, including glutamine, taurine, and betaine, offer immediate clinical relevance given their established utilization in clinical nutrition and animal feed formulations; the elucidation of Nrf2-mediated mechanisms now provides a rational basis for optimizing dosing regimens and developing targeted combination therapies. Lipid-based activators, particularly omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, benefit from well-characterized dietary incorporation pathways and integrate intestinal barrier protection with established cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. Polysaccharides present exceptional advantages through their prebiotic properties and compatibility with existing dietary supplementation infrastructure, whereas organic acids currently employed as antimicrobial feed preservatives now possess mechanistic justification for their observed gut health benefits through Nrf2 pathway activation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>54386</offset><text>Microbiome-based interventions constitute particularly promising therapeutic strategies warranting focused development. Probiotics represent the most clinically advanced approach, with Nrf2 activation identified as a conserved protective mechanism across taxonomically diverse species, thereby providing a rational framework for strain selection and combination therapy design. The emergence of next-generation probiotics, including Akkermansia muciniphila and specific Clostridium species, opens additional therapeutic avenues. Microbial metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids and tryptophan derivatives, function as the mechanistic interface between dietary intake, microbiome composition, and host intestinal health.

Ginsenosides are progressing through Western clinical trials following extensive historical application in traditional Chinese medicine, establishing precedent for related terpenoid compounds. Berberine represents one of the most clinically advanced natural Nrf2 activators, with demonstrated efficacy in human metabolic and gastrointestinal disorders and regulatory approval in several countries for diarrheal diseases. Its established efficacy in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-infected piglet models further supports therapeutic development for both agricultural applications and pediatric gastroenteritis.

Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>56893</offset><text>This review demonstrates that the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway serves as a central therapeutic target for intestinal inflammatory disorders. Diverse agents—including polyphenols (resveratrol, quercetin, curcumin), terpenoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, and probiotics—activate NRF2 through distinct mechanisms: direct Keap1 cysteine modification, upstream kinase signaling, and gut microbiota-derived metabolites. These compounds exhibit coordinated dual-pathway regulation, simultaneously enhancing Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defenses while suppressing NF-κB-driven inflammation. Beyond classical antioxidant induction, Nrf2 activation promotes multiple protective mechanisms including ferroptosis inhibition, tight junction reinforcement, and inflammasome suppression. The gut microbiota critically modulates therapeutic efficacy through metabolite production and compound biotransformation. These findings establish Nrf2 pathway modulation as a promising multi-targeted strategy for managing IBD in both clinical and livestock settings. However, several knowledge gaps and challenges remain. First, most studies rely on rodent models, and translational validation in larger animals and human clinical trials is needed. Second, the optimal dosing regimens, delivery systems, and long-term safety profiles of Nrf2 activators require further investigation. Third, the interplay between Nrf2 activation and gut microbiota composition warrants mechanistic studies. Future research should focus on developing species-specific formulations, investigating synergistic effects of combined Nrf2 activators, and conducting comparative efficacy studies across different livestock species.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>58578</offset><text>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
