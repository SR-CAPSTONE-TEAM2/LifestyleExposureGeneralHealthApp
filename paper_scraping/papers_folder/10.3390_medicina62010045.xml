Additionally, the study aims to provide data that will enable earlier transition to second-line treatment when necessary. Materials and Methods: The study included 62 patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis between 2018 and 2023, who were followed up at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition at the University of Health Sciences, Izmir Dr. Behçet Uz Children’s Hospital. Demographic data included age and gender at diagnosis, BMI, weight-for-age, and height-for-age. Laboratory parameters recorded were complete blood count, total protein, albumin, CRP, ESR, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgG subclasses, vitamin D, B12, folic acid, and ferritin levels. Results: The study included 62 patients. Thirty-two patients (51.6%) were female. In the univariate regression analysis, there was an inverse correlation between IgM levels and relapse and steroid dependence (p &lt; 0.01, p = 0.03, respectively). Additionally, a relationship was identified between steroid dependence and hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, platelet count, and albumin levels (p = 0.01, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.01, p = 0.01, p &lt; 0.01, p = 0.03, respectively). There was a significant relationship between MMES and steroid dependence (p &lt; 0.01). MMES was found to be significant in predicting steroid dependence in patients with pancolitis (AUC: 0.75, 95% CI: [0.60–0.90], p = 0.01). Conclusions: We conclude, as for Crohn’s disease, an algorithm or a specific scoring system for ulcerative colitis is needed for the use of anti-TNF drugs as first-line treatment in pediatric ulcerative colitis. The initial severity of the disease appears to be the most important risk factor in terms of steroid dependence. Based on our study and the literature data, a scoring system incorporating parameters such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, albumin, platelet, and IgM levels, disease involvement type, initial PUCAI score, and MMES would be prudent to adopt.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2222</offset><text>1.

The prevalence of the disease varies by country, ranging from 1 to 20 per 100,000, and the incidence of the disease is increasing annually.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2539</offset><text>Today, we still do not fully understand the pathophysiology of the disease. One observation is that there is a breakdown of the mucosal barrier which activates neutrophils, macrophages and natural killer cells. An additional observation is the triggering of the adaptive immune response. Genetic, microbiota and environmental factors also play a role in the onset of the disease, along with this immune response.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2952</offset><text>The most common symptoms of the disease are often bloody diarrhea, chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, and developmental delay.

The updated Porto criteria, comprising 23 evaluation criteria including endoscopy data, both macroscopic and histopathological, clinical findings, and laboratory parameters, serve as a guide for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. To define the spread of the disease, it was recommended that the Montreal Classification initially be used, but the revised Paris Classification is now the recommendation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3768</offset><text>The PUCAI score is another method used to determine the severity of the disease at diagnosis. It evaluates the clinical findings for the purpose of classifying patients into four groups: remission, mild, moderate, and severe. ESPGHAN’s treatment algorithm is based on the PUCAI score of the patient at diagnosis. For mild to moderate disease without systemic findings, the algorithm recommends high-dose oral 5-ASA and enemas for proctitis. For severe colitis, the algorithm recommends oral or intravenous steroid therapy in addition to systemic findings.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4326</offset><text>The use of anti-TNF drugs, such as infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab, is recommended in patients who do not respond to steroid treatment, who experience an attack while continuing steroid treatment, or who experience an attack shortly after discontinuing steroid treatment. If these treatments are ineffective, recommended therapies would turn to anti-integrin (vedolizumab) and anti-IL23 (ustekinumab). Dual biological agent therapies may also be administered to prevent the need for surgical interventions. If medical treatments are ineffective, surgical treatment should be considered.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4919</offset><text>During an inflammatory bowel disease flare-up, the primary objective is to promptly suppress disease activity. In the case of Crohn’s disease, when the diagnosis is made in a high-risk situation—that is, in the presence of severe growth retardation, perianal disease, stricture, or widespread and deep ulcers—it is recommended that treatment with anti-TNF drugs be initiated without delay, prior to the administration of first-line treatments. Previous studies have demonstrated associations between disease severity and factors such as anemia at diagnosis, hypoalbuminemia, and higher PUCAI scores; however, a clear and definitive recommendation for ulcerative colitis cannot yet be established. The objective of this study is to ascertain the predictive criteria for steroid dependence and relapse in patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Additionally, the study aims to provide data that will enable earlier transition to second-line treatment when necessary.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5894</offset><text>2.

Nominal and ordinal variables were compared with the chi-square test of independence. The chi-square test of independence was employed to assess the relationship between nominal and ordinal variables. In the event that the comparison of numerical variables was parametric according to the distribution, a paired-sample t-test was employed; conversely, if nonparametric, Wilcoxon’s two-sample test was utilized. In the case of comparisons between more than two independent groups, the Kruskal–Wallis test was employed. A logistic regression analysis was conducted for laboratory parameters. To determine the accuracy of laboratory markers for prognostic tests, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn by plotting sensitivity against 1-specificity. Overall accuracy of the marker in predicting the respective disease outcome was represented by area under the ROC curve (AUC) with 95% CI. The best cut-off point was calculated using the Youden-Index, defined as the maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>9828</offset><text>3.

Moreover, this was significant in predicting steroid-free remission with AUC: 0.76, 74.2% sens., 80% spec. above 99.5. Song et al. examined 608 adults with Crohn’s disease, and found there was an inverse correlation between ileal disease severity and IgM levels. Various studies have shown that IgM levels vary due to dysbiosis or genetic causes. Preisker et al. reported a significant increase in intestinal IgM+ B cells in Crohn’s disease patients in remission. Although data are scant on this, it has been suggested that IgM levels may be associated with mucosal health. It should be noted that IgM levels were analyzed as a continuous variable, and the observed associations reflect relative differences within the cohort rather than age-adjusted immunoglobulin deficiency.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22748</offset><text>From a methodological standpoint, the findings of this study highlight the need for prospective and multicenter investigations to further explore the prognostic value of combined clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic parameters in pediatric ulcerative colitis. Such studies may help determine whether these markers can be integrated into structured risk assessment models, while accounting for disease heterogeneity and treatment variability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>23190</offset><text>5.

The initial severity of the disease appears to be the most important risk factor in terms of steroid dependence. Based on our study and the literature data, a scoring system incorporating parameters such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, albumin, platelet, disease involvement type, initial PUCAI score, and MMES would be prudent to adopt. While the study data demonstrate the significance of IgM levels, further research is necessary to reach more precise conclusions. We believe more definitive results will be obtained with larger patient series and the use of prospective planning.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>24238</offset><text>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
