In a recent paper based on the Global Burden of Disease database, the United States (US) had the highest age-standardized prevalence rate globally, with nearly a quarter of the total global patients with IBD in 2017. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by central obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension (HTN) and dyslipidemia, with visceral adiposity driving insulin resistance through proinflammatory cytokine production. Among US adults aged 18 years or older, the prevalence of MetS in the general population rose by more than 35% from 1988-1994 to 2007-2012, increasing from 25.3% to 34.2%. Emerging data suggest that the metabolic disturbances associated with MetS, including inflammation driven by visceral adiposity, may intersect with the pathophysiological mechanisms of IBD, potentially exacerbating disease progression and complicating management strategies. However, despite this plausible biological interplay, the epidemiology of MetS in IBD remains incompletely understood and underreported in the US, during this ever-rising epidemic of obesity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2849</offset><text>Earlier studies have reported widely varying prevalence estimates for MetS in IBD, typically ranging from 15-40%, depending on the population characteristics and diagnostic criteria used. Indeed, both obesity and MetS are increasingly recognized in IBD, with the shifting demographics of IBD reflecting broader societal trends in obesity. Moreover, there is evidence that obesity, through altered microbiota composition and chronic low-grade inflammation, may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD. However, most of the existing studies examining the co-occurrence of MetS and IBD predate the widespread use of biologic therapies, or are limited by modest sample sizes and geographically constrained cohorts. This lack of contemporary, large-scale data hampers our understanding of the epidemiology of MetS in patients with IBD and its impact on their disease course in the biologic era.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3737</offset><text>Given the rising prevalence of obesity and MetS globally, the role of visceral adiposity in driving insulin resistance, and the potential for these metabolic derangements to worsen IBD outcomes, updated epidemiological data are urgently needed.

MetS was defined by any 3 or more of the following criteria: HTN, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, HDL &lt;45 mg/dL, and TG ≥150 mg/dL. These criteria were largely based on the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) and International Diabetes Federation guidelines, which can be applied to the US population. We used ICD-10-CM codes for HTN and T2DM, instead of recorded blood pressure measurements or fasting glucose, to better reflect the chronic disease status, rather than a single elevated measurement. Similarly, we employed ICD-10-CM codes for obesity, rather than waist circumference, given the limited availability of anthropometric data, and because obesity diagnosis codes have been shown to have high specificity. An HDL cutoff of &lt;45 mg/dL was used uniformly for both men and women, because the database does not allow for gender-specific cutoffs. We believe these criteria are clinically practical and can be used for future MetS studies using administrative or claims-based databases.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8230</offset><text>MetS prevalence was reported by age group (18-39, 40-65, and &gt;65 years), sex and race, for both UC and CD.

We observed that more than one-third of patients with UC and CD met the criteria for MetS, with the highest rates in elderly patients, males, and among the American Indian or Alaska native, Black and Hispanic populations. The increasing trend in the prevalence of MetS is explained by the increase in the prevalence of all individual components of MetS over a decade. The rapid increase in prevalence with age indicates that, given the demographic trend of an aging population, further increases in MetS are likely, accompanied by higher rates of associated chronic conditions. Disease phenotype also correlated with MetS prevalence; more extensive UC involvement (pancolitis), a history of ASUC, stricturing CD and CD-related surgery were associated with higher prevalence of MetS. Interestingly, patients on advanced therapy had a lower MetS prevalence, though it is unclear if this was due to differences in disease behavior, less corticosteroid use or other confounding factors.

Shen et al conducted a meta-analysis, revealing that MetS is a relatively common comorbidity in patients with IBD, with a pooled prevalence estimated at 19.4% (95%CI 15.1-23.8%). In another population-based study of 489 patients with IBD, 18% of patients were diagnosed with obesity (compared with 23% of the general population), and 38% of patients were overweight; this proportion was comparable between patients with CD (18% with obesity) or UC (17.5% with obesity). In a study by Flores et al, the authors reported that up to 25% of USA patients with IBD were diagnosed with obesity, which paralleled the obesity rate in the US back in 2015. Our data showed that the prevalence was approximately 45% for obesity and over 30% for MetS. European and Asian cohorts previously had generally lower MetS rates (10-30%), perhaps attributable to geographic variations in obesity prevalence, healthcare practices and the overall health of the population. After stratification of IBD into UC and CD, our study reported a MetS prevalence of 32.4% and 34.3% among these groups. Previously a meta-analysis reported that the prevalence of MetS is significantly higher in UC (38.2%, 95%CI 20.4-59.9%) compared to CD (13.6%, 95%CI 6.4-26.7%), with sensitivity analyses suggesting up to twice the risk in UC (OR 2.11, 95%CI 1.19-3.74).

Similarly, a study by Nagahori et al reported that patients with IBD and MetS were significantly older than those without at the time of evaluation (50.2±15.0 vs. 38.0±11.9 years, P=0.013), and at the time of diagnosis (41.6 ± 16.7 vs. 30.9±11.5 years, P=0.011), with age identified as an independent predictor of MetS (OR 1.064, 95%CI 1.017-1.114). Similarly, Fitzmorris et al reported that patients with IBD and MetS were older as compared with those without MetS (P&lt;0.001). Our study also reported that male patients were more likely to have MetS and IBD. Nagahori et al reported that the prevalence of MetS was higher in male patients with IBD (21.1%) than in females (12.9%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.414). This difference was probably due to the small sample size in the comparison study. The racial and ethnic distribution of both IBD and MetS in the US remains poorly understood, with a significant paucity of data. A recent study by Lewis et al reported that IBD prevalence is nearly twice as high among non-Hispanic White Americans, compared to Black, Hispanic and Asian Americans. Similarly, national data reveal notable racial disparities in MetS prevalence, with non-Hispanic Black men showing lower rates, but non-Hispanic Black women exhibiting higher rates compared to their White counterparts. However, our study is the first to highlight that MetS is more prevalent among the Black and Hispanic populations within the IBD cohort. On a similar note, a study by Zhang et al reported that patients from China have a lower prevalence of MetS compared to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican Americans across all age groups. This supports our finding that the Asian patients with IBD had a lower prevalence of MetS compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Future research exploring the underlying causes of MetS in patients with IBD is essential to understanding how risk factors contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in its prevalence, providing insights into the inequalities observed among diverse population groups over time.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21104</offset><text>Recent epidemiologic data indicate that the burden of MetS in the general US adult population now ranges from 34-36%. For instance, a 2023 analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (2011-2018) reported MetS rates exceeding 35%, similar to earlier figures of roughly 34.7% from 2011-2016. Meanwhile, the latest national report notes that the prevalence of obesity among US adults, a major contributor to MetS, has surpassed 40%. Compared to our findings of 32.4-34.3% in patients with IBD, it appears that MetS now affects individuals with IBD at rates mirroring those seen in the general population, underscoring a shift away from the traditional perception that IBD is primarily associated with malnutrition or low body weight. In our study, MetS prevalence correlated with potentially worse disease phenotypes, such as ASUC and stricturing phenotype in CD. This can probably be translated to outcomes in patients with obesity and UC, where in a study by Jain et al reported obesity was independently associated in a dose-dependent fashion with worsening disease activity. On the other hand, systemic steroids remain a cornerstone of therapy for acute flares in both UC and CD; however, they are also well recognized to induce or exacerbate features of MetS—such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia—through complex effects on glucose metabolism, adipose tissue distribution and insulin sensitivity. Prolonged or repeated steroid use is frequently necessitated by more severe or refractory disease, and can drive weight gain and insulin resistance, heightening the risk for MetS in susceptible individuals. Several reports have documented an increased incidence of obesity and metabolic abnormalities in patients with IBD treated with chronic corticosteroids, underscoring the fact that disease severity, pharmacologic management and cardiometabolic outcomes are closely intertwined. Consequently, patients with more aggressive or extensive disease, and those who receive higher cumulative doses of corticosteroid, may be at greater risk for MetS. Our matched analyses also showed higher systemic steroid exposure and greater colectomy/surgery among patients with IBD and MetS, consistent with evidence that obesity, a core MetS component, is linked to worse disease activity, poorer patient-reported outcomes and higher hospitalization risk in IBD. Therapeutically, MetS may diminish biologic effectiveness and necessitate escalation, as a higher body mass index predicts earlier loss of response to infliximab and dose escalation with adalimumab. These data support routine assessment and management of MetS to guide steroid-sparing, treat-to-target decisions and biologic optimization, aiming to improve long-term outcomes while minimizing corticosteroid-related metabolic harm.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23930</offset><text>Our study also reports trends of each component of MetS from 2010-2023. The increasing prevalence of MetS in the IBD population parallels trends seen in the general population. MetS, characterized by visceral adiposity, insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, may exacerbate intestinal inflammation and complicate disease management in IBD patients. Emerging evidence suggests that MetS components, such as dyslipidemia and HTN, may influence the disease course and therapeutic response, including altered pharmacokinetics of biologic agents. Despite these insights, data on the long-term impact of MetS on IBD progression, complications and comorbidities remain scarce. With MetS rates expected to rise further in this population, integrating targeted interventions, such as lifestyle modification and metabolic risk management into IBD care is crucial for improving outcomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24814</offset><text>The key strengths of our study include its large sample size and real-world nature, which encompasses diverse geographical regions within the US. Our use of clinically pragmatic MetS criteria allows reproducibility in other administrative and claims databases. This large-scale approach can capture trends that smaller or single-center studies might miss, shedding light on the intersection of MetS and IBD in the contemporary era of biologic and small-molecule therapies. Our study reports the prevalence of MetS across different demographic groups and is stratified by disease location, phenotype and medication use.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25433</offset><text>Our study also has several limitations that merit discussion. First, misclassification bias remains possible, given our reliance on ICD-10-CM and procedure codes. While the accuracy of identification of patients with IBD from an administrative database has been studied, identification of subgroups within patients with IBD, based on disease extent and phenotype, has not been validated. Given our large sample sizes, we utilized a combination of &gt;1 ICD-10-CM codes and procedure codes commonly utilized in clinical practice, which our group felt would increase the accuracy of identifying different subgroups of UC and CD. The definitions of subgroups have been included in the Supplementary document, and can be used in future studies for consistency, as well as validation of diagnostic and procedure codes. Second, our MetS definition used a single HDL threshold for both men and women, and substituted ICD-10-CM codes for waist circumference and blood pressure; comparisons to strictly ATP III-defined cohorts should therefore be interpreted with caution. Third, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle behaviors and medication adherence, which are important in both IBD and MetS, were not fully captured. Fourth, owing to restrictions of the de-identified TriNetX platform, and the lack of patient-level data export and support for user-defined time-to-event endpoints, we could not construct a comprehensive multivariable “independent predictors” model or implement a Cox proportional hazards analysis for our composite IBD outcome; future studies with patient-level datasets are needed to address these questions rigorously. Finally, as with all database studies, there is always concern over misdiagnosis, residual confounding and under-reporting of some variables.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27205</offset><text>In conclusion, our study highlights the epidemiology of MetS among patients with IBD in the US, with a prevalence of more than one-third of patients with UC and CD. This rising trend mirrors broader societal shifts in metabolic dysfunction, and underscores the association of MetS with severe IBD phenotypes. Future research should explore the mechanistic interplay between metabolic and inflammatory pathways to guide targeted interventions and to clarify whether metabolic interventions could favorably alter the disease course or improve treatment outcomes in IBD. These findings provide critical insights into the evolving epidemiology of IBD and offer a foundation for strategies to improve patient outcomes while addressing health disparities.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27955</offset><text> Summary Box </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27969</offset><text> What is already known: </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27994</offset><text>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects about one-third of United States (US) adults and is rising with population aging and obesity</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28121</offset><text>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and MetS share inflammatory and metabolic pathways, but contemporary large US data quantifying MetS in IBD have been limited and heterogeneous</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28297</offset><text>The clinical impact of MetS on IBD course (e.g., need for steroids or surgery) is incompletely defined</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28400</offset><text> What the new findings are: </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28429</offset><text>From 2010-2023, one-third of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) met the criteria for MetS</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28549</offset><text>MetS prevalence rises steeply with age, is higher in men, and is greatest among Black, Hispanic and American Indian patients; Asian patients have the lowest prevalence</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28717</offset><text>MetS clusters with more extensive/severe IBD phenotypes (pancolitis, acute severe UC, stricturing CD, prior CD surgery); advanced-therapy use is not associated with higher MetS prevalence (and is lower than 5-aminosalicylic acid use in UC)</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28957</offset><text>After propensity matching, MetS is associated with greater systemic steroid exposure and higher surgery/colectomy rates, while stricture and fistula risks are similar</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>29124</offset><text>Conflict of Interest: AD, HK and PS: None exist.
