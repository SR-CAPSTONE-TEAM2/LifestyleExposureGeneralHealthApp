These findings support the hypothesis that integrating structured nutritional risk screening and individualized nutrition management into routine IBD care may be beneficial. However, given the observational design and potential residual confounding, the observed associations should not be interpreted as definitive causal effects, and prospective multicenter randomized studies are needed to confirm these results and guide clinical practice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>3803</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3816</offset><text>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), comprising Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic, relapsing condition with a rising global prevalence and substantial healthcare burden. A pivotal contributor to its poor prognosis is malnutrition, which arises from a detrimental cycle of reduced intake, malabsorption due to inflamed mucosa, and inflammation-driven hypermetabolism. The prevalence of malnutrition is high and variable (20%–85%), often accompanied by specific micronutrient deficiencies, and is strongly linked to infections, poor wound healing, and worsened outcomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4405</offset><text>Crucially, malnutrition is not merely a consequence but also a driver of disease activity. Impaired nutritional status significantly elevates the risk of relapse and is independently associated with reduced quality of life in IBD patients. This underscores why nutritional assessment is a cornerstone of management. International guidelines accordingly recommend routine nutritional risk screening using validated tools like NRS-2002 and MUST to enable early identification and intervention.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4897</offset><text>Nutritional intervention has become an integral component of comprehensive IBD therapy. Studies have shown that oral nutritional supplement (ONS) in Crohn’s disease patients in remission can significantly prolong the duration of remission. For patients with active disease, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been demonstrated to induce remission. In adult CD patients, EN is effective in inducing clinical remission (albeit slightly less so than corticosteroids), while in pediatric CD it is regarded as a first-line therapy. According to ESPEN guidelines, enteral nutrition should be prioritized in IBD patients with inadequate oral intake due to inflammation or complications, to maintain intestinal integrity and improve disease outcomes. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is indicated when EN is not feasible or when severe intestinal dysfunction exists. These international studies and guidelines underscore the importance of establishing nutritional support strategies; however, further work is needed to clarify how best to implement structured, risk-stratified nutritional care pathways in routine IBD management.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6017</offset><text>Although nutritional screening and support therapy are recognized as crucial aspects of IBD management, there is still no universally adopted, standardized protocol for how best to operationalize nutritional risk–stratified care in routine practice. Existing studies, including nutrition-focused interventions, screening-based approaches, and partial enteral nutrition programmes, have provided important insights, but real-world evaluations of structured, dietitian-led nutritional pathways remain relatively limited. This study adds real-world evidence from a large single-center cohort implementing a structured nutritional risk-stratification pathway. We classified and managed IBD patients according to their nutritional risk level and evaluated the association between this pathway and relapse rates, inflammatory markers, hospitalization outcomes, and quality of life. The aim is to assess whether nutrition support guided by routine nutritional risk assessment is associated with improved IBD prognosis, and to provide incremental data that may inform future development of IBD nutrition management strategies and support clinical decision-making. In this context, our retrospective cohort analysis should be viewed as a pragmatic contribution to the growing body of evidence on integrating nutritional risk management into comprehensive IBD care, rather than as establishing a conceptually novel intervention model.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>7444</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7466</offset><text>Study design and participants</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7496</offset><text>This single-center, retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with IBD who were hospitalized or received outpatient follow-up in three departments of the Gastroenterology Division at Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University between 1 January 2024 and 31 December 2024.

After systematic screening, patients lacking complete medical records, nutritional screening records, or with a follow-up duration of less than 3 months were excluded. A total of 752 patients meeting the study criteria were ultimately included [408 with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and 344 with Crohn’s Disease (CD)], representing approximately 38% of the annual case load. This sample size was deemed sufficient for the statistical analysis of the primary outcomes. The dietitian-led nutritional risk stratification pathway had been implemented at our center as a routine quality-improvement program before the study period.

Screen-positive patients underwent a comprehensive nutritional assessment, including dietary intake status, weight change, body mass index (BMI), and laboratory parameters [e.g., serum albumin (Alb), prealbumin (PAB), hemoglobin (Hb)], which informed the development of an individualized intervention plan. Nutritional interventions were delivered by specialist dietitians in collaboration with clinicians, adhering to the principles of “stratified management, individualized intervention, and dynamic assessment” to ensure scientific rigor and continuity of care.

In cases of mild lactose intolerance, low-lactose or peptide-based formulas were substituted. ONS was advised to be taken in 2–3 divided doses between meals to improve absorption and prevent early satiety. Tolerance, proportion of energy intake from ONS, and intestinal responses were assessed every 2 weeks, with adjustments made to the formula and dosage accordingly.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19179</offset><text>EN: EN was initiated for high-risk patients or those whose oral intake was less than 60% of the recommended energy needs.

Energy targets were set at 20–30 kcal/kg/day, protein at 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day, with non-protein energy distributed between carbohydrates and fat at a 55:45 ratio. Administration methods included intermittent bolus feeding (250–300 mL per session, every 3–4 h) or continuous infusion, starting at a rate of 80–100 mL/h and gradually reaching the target volume within 24–48 h. The EN course lasted 2–8 weeks, during which weight, intestinal tolerance, and adverse reactions (e.g., bloating, diarrhea) were assessed weekly, and the prescription was adjusted based on laboratory parameters (Alb, CRP, blood glucose).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20293</offset><text>PN: PN was reserved for patients with severe intestinal dysfunction or complete intolerance to EN (e.g., intestinal obstruction, short bowel syndrome, severe postoperative inflammation).

Adherence was defined as “good” if re-evaluation records existed and were consecutive for ≥2 sessions. Reasons for interrupted intervention or refused follow-up were documented and considered in sensitivity analyses. An internal quality control mechanism was established, involving quarterly random audits of 10% of cases by a senior dietitian to verify consistency between screening forms, intervention records, and follow-up data. All intervention procedures strictly followed the hospital’s nutritional management protocols to ensure data traceability and research reproducibility. To characterize the actual implementation of the pathway beyond the theoretical targets, we extracted dietitian documentation on prescribed and achieved energy and protein intake for each visit. For each patient, the mean daily energy intake (kcal/kg/day) and protein intake (g/kg/day) actually consumed during the intervention period were calculated and expressed as a proportion of the individual prescribed targets; these data are summarized as medians (interquartile ranges) in Supplementary Table 2. In addition, we recorded, for each patient, which nutritional modalities were received (dietary education only, education plus ONS, EN, PN, or combinations thereof), the timing and direction of any escalation (e.g., education → ONS → EN → PN), and the duration of each modality (weeks from initiation to step-down or discontinuation). Follow-up intensity was quantified as the number of in-person dietitian visits and structured telephone contacts per patient over 12 months, and adherence was operationalized as the proportion of planned dietitian contacts actually attended and, where available, the proportion of days on which ≥75% of the prescribed ONS or EN volume was documented as consumed. Descriptive distributions of these intervention components, durations, and adherence metrics for the intervention group are presented in Supplementary Table 2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23952</offset><text>  Control group</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23970</offset><text>Patients in the control group were not enrolled in the systematic nutritional risk stratification management pathway.

By study design, all patients in this group had at least one NRS-2002 or MUST score recorded during routine care (as required for study inclusion), but they were not enrolled in the structured, dietitian-led nutritional risk stratification pathway. Any nutritional risk information, when available, was used at the discretion of the treating physician and was not linked to a predefined algorithm of dietitian-delivered assessment, intervention, and scheduled follow-up. Physicians might inquire about dietary habits during routine consultations and offer general lifestyle advice, such as avoiding spicy, high-fat, or hard-to-digest foods and increasing fluid and dietary fiber intake. However, no specific energy or protein intake targets were set, and no formal written or electronic nutritional follow-up plan was initiated. If patients voluntarily consumed ONS or health formula powders based on personal choice or online information during the treatment period—without professional dietitian evaluation, prescription, or scheduled follow-up—this behavior was considered an unstructured individual action and not counted as part of the intervention. In data recording, such individuals were retained but separately flagged for subsequent sensitivity analysis. The follow-up cycle for control group patients was typically every 2–3 months, encompassing condition assessment, laboratory testing, medication adherence evaluation, and treatment regimen adjustments. All follow-ups were conducted by the same clinical team to maintain consistency in information collection and decision-making criteria. During follow-up, physicians could provide general advice regarding disease progression, medication side effects, or signs of malnutrition but did not initiate formal nutritional consultation procedures or intervention records. In the main analysis, these patients remained in the control group, but we additionally performed per-protocol sensitivity analyses in which such patients were excluded or, alternatively, reclassified as partially exposed; the results of these analyses were similar to those of the primary analysis (Supplementary Table 3).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27890</offset><text>Regarding data management, all clinical, laboratory, and follow-up data for the control group were extracted from the hospital’s electronic medical record system.

For patients lost to follow-up or with missing data, the research team documented specific reasons (e.g., relocation, withdrawal from follow-up, or referral) and included them in the missing data analysis module for multiple imputation processing. Ethically, control group patients received the same rights to information and privacy protection management as the intervention group. All medical practices adhered to the hospital’s clinical routines, and the study did not intervene in or pose any risk to their treatment plans. The establishment of this group served as a conventional treatment control, aimed at comparing the clinical effects and disease outcomes of the systematic nutritional management model.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>28933</offset><text>Outcome measures</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>28950</offset><text>Nutritional risk and nutritional status indicators</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29001</offset><text>For this analysis, baseline nutritional risk and nutritional status were defined using the first available NRS-2002 or MUST assessment during the study period and the corresponding anthropometric and laboratory data recorded in the electronic medical record. Nutritional risk was assessed using the NRS-2002 or the MUST. In the intervention group, these assessments were systematically performed by registered dietitians at admission or the initial outpatient visit, at the time of entry into the institutional nutrition pathway, and inpatients were re-screened within 7–10 days as part of structured follow-up, with all results documented in the electronic medical record. In the control group, the baseline NRS-2002 or MUST score was derived from routine clinical care and could be completed opportunistically by physicians or nurses according to hospital policy; these assessments were not linked to a predefined algorithm of dietitian-delivered assessment, intervention, and scheduled re-evaluation. An NRS-2002 score ≥ 3 or a MUST score ≥ 1 was defined as indicative of nutritional risk. All available NRS-2002/MUST scores, irrespective of the assessor, were extracted from the electronic medical record for the present study. Because NRS-2002 and MUST have different scoring structures and were developed in different settings, we did not pool their raw scores directly. Instead, each patient was classified into one of three harmonized nutritional risk categories (low, moderate, high) according to the thresholds recommended in the original validation studies (NRS-2002: 0–2, 3–4, ≥5; MUST: 0, 1, ≥2). These three-level categories were then used as indicators of baseline nutritional risk in the main analyses, irrespective of the specific tool applied. As a sensitivity analysis, key models were repeated in the subset of patients assessed with NRS-2002 only; the pattern and magnitude of associations were similar (Supplementary Table 4).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30964</offset><text>Anthropometric measurements included height, weight, body mass index (BMI = weight/height2), and percentage weight change [%ΔBW = (current weight–baseline weight)/baseline weight × 100%].

First, we compared basic demographic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, disease type, markers of disease activity and inflammation, and department of care) between included and excluded patients. Second, we compared patients with at least one documented NRS-2002/MUST screening record and those without screening among the 1,892 IBD patients managed during the study period. Continuous variables were compared using t-test or Mann–Whitney U test, and categorical variables using χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. These comparisons are presented in Supplementary Tables 5, 6 to allow readers to judge the representativeness of the analytic cohort and to contextualize potential selection mechanisms. To further describe the complexity and heterogeneity of the nutritional intervention, we summarized the distribution of intervention components within the dietitian-led pathway. Specifically, we calculated the proportion of patients receiving dietary education only, education plus ONS, EN, PN, or combinations of these modalities; the median duration (weeks) of each modality; and the intensity of follow-up (number of dietitian contacts) in the intervention group. We also quantified the ratio of achieved to prescribed energy and protein intake for each patient. These descriptive data are reported in Supplementary Table 2 and are intended to help readers interpret the “dose” and composition of nutritional exposure. To address potential contamination in the control group, we pre-specified per-protocol sensitivity analyses excluding patients who self-initiated ONS or other substantial dietary changes without dietitian involvement, as well as an analysis reclassifying such patients as partially exposed; results are presented in Supplementary Table 3.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40380</offset><text>For continuous variables conforming to a normal distribution, independent samples t-tests were used; for variables deviating from normality, the Mann-Whitney U test was employed.

Time-to-event analysis for relapse was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The proportional hazards assumption was verified using Schoenfeld residual tests. Multivariable models were adjusted for potential confounders of relapse risk, including age, sex, disease type (UC or CD), disease duration, baseline disease activity score, serum Alb, CRP, BMI, and medication categories (5-ASA, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics, or small molecule targeted agents). The inclusion of these covariates was based on previous literature evidence and clinical relevance. In addition, we constructed an a priori directed acyclic graph (DAG; Supplementary Figure 1) to represent our assumptions about the relationships between nutritional management, disease activity, comorbidities, health-care utilization, and relapse risk, and used this framework to guide the selection of covariates for the Cox models and propensity score analyses. Time-to-event analysis for relapse was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

To further address the possibility of immortal time bias, we performed an additional time-dependent Cox analysis in which entry into the nutritional pathway was modeled as a time-varying covariate that changed from 0 to 1 on the date of first dietitian-led pathway entry; the estimated association between nutritional management and relapse risk remained materially unchanged (Supplementary Table 1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43291</offset><text>Analyses of secondary outcomes included relapse frequency, changes in quality of life, hospitalization rates, and rescue medication use.

This model included random effects for individuals to account for within-subject correlation due to repeated measures.

Consequently, 752 eligible patients were ultimately enrolled (enrollment rate: 39.8%). This cohort included 408 patients (54.3%) with UC and 344 patients (45.7%) with CD. A detailed flow diagram of patient selection is shown in Figure 1.

The results showed that the direction of the intervention’s effect on relapse risk was consistent across subgroups defined by disease type (UC vs. CD), baseline disease activity (mild-moderate vs. severe), nutritional risk level (low, moderate, high), and treatment regimen (use of biologics or immunomodulators vs. not). None of the interaction terms reached statistical significance (all interaction p &gt; 0.1). This indicates that the relapse risk reduction effect of systematic nutritional management is generalizable and not significantly modified by disease subtype or treatment strategy differences. Notably, the intervention effect was most pronounced in moderate-to-high nutritional risk populations and those with higher baseline disease activity (HR = 0.56 and 0.51, respectively), reinforcing the “risk-dependent” nature of the benefit from stratified management. Patients with poorer baseline nutritional status or higher inflammatory burden experienced greater reductions in relapse risk from nutritional intervention. This finding is consistent with the previous analyses of quality of life and inflammatory markers, and is compatible with a potential role of improved nutritional status in disease control.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">T6.xml</infon><infon key="id">T6</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>72883</offset><text>Subgroup and sensitivity analyses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">T6.xml</infon><infon key="id">T6</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

The results of the Cox proportional hazards model after multiple imputation were consistent with the complete case analysis (HR≈0.61, 95% CI: 0.46–0.83), suggesting that missing data did not significantly affect the primary conclusions. The IPTW analysis also remained robust (weighted HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.44–0.81, p = 0.001), indicating that nutritional stratification management remained independently associated with reduced relapse risk after weighting adjustment. Furthermore, an E-value analysis yielded a result of 2.01, suggesting that an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both the exposure and outcome by a risk ratio of approximately 2.01 each, above and beyond the measured covariates, to fully explain away the observed association. However, an E-value of this magnitude is modest and compatible with the presence of plausible unmeasured confounders in routine IBD care; therefore, the analysis should be interpreted as quantifying the robustness of the association to measured covariates rather than ruling out residual confounding. Together, the subgroup and sensitivity analyses suggest that nutritional risk stratification management is consistently associated with lower relapse risk across different patient subgroups, supporting a potential role for this pathway as a component of long-term IBD management while underscoring that causal inferences cannot be definitively drawn from these data.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>75192</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>75203</offset><text>Malnutrition is a highly prevalent and clinically significant comorbidity in IBD, with multifactorial origins encompassing reduced oral intake, nutrient malabsorption, and a chronic inflammatory state that elevates metabolic demands. It affects a substantial proportion of patients, with estimates ranging from 20% to 80% across different cohorts. Critically, malnutrition is not merely a secondary consequence but an independent driver of adverse outcomes, contributing to an increased risk of disease relapse, suboptimal response to therapy, and a diminished quality of life. Against this established backdrop, our study was designed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a systematic nutritional risk stratification management pathway in a cohort of IBD patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>75976</offset><text>Our primary findings indicate that this structured, dietitian-led pathway was associated with significant and multi-faceted benefits relative to conventional care. The intervention group demonstrated superior recovery of nutritional status, evidenced by more pronounced gains in body weight and key serological markers like albumin. This outcome aligns with and extends evidence from previous controlled trials, such as those demonstrating the nutritional efficacy of the Mediterranean diet in Crohn’s disease or the value of preoperative nutritional optimization. Our results suggest that a pragmatic, risk-stratified program implemented in a routine clinical setting can successfully translate these principles into tangible patient benefit, reinforcing the call for personalized, dietitian-guided nutritional strategies to improve adherence and outcomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>76836</offset><text>In parallel, we observed a consistent reduction in objective markers of systemic and intestinal inflammation, namely CRP and fecal calprotectin, alongside improvements in standardized disease activity indices. This supports the biologically plausible concept that sustained nutritional repletion and modulation can mitigate underlying inflammatory processes in IBD. The observed effect aligns with clinical trials of structured nutritional regimens, such as the Crohn’s Disease Exclusion Diet, which have demonstrated efficacy in reducing gut inflammation, and with mechanistic studies indicating that nutritional therapies may promote mucosal healing. While short-term, isolated dietary modifications may not invariably produce significant shifts in systemic markers like CRP, our study—featuring a longer-term, multimodal intervention—suggests that a more comprehensive and sustained nutritional approach can contribute to inflammatory downregulation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>77796</offset><text>A particularly compelling finding was the association of the nutritional management pathway with a reduced incidence of disease relapse and fewer IBD-related hospitalizations. This directly addresses a major clinical concern, as malnutrition is a well-recognized risk factor for disease recurrence. By systematically improving a patient’s nutritional substrate, the intervention may help disrupt the vicious cycle wherein inflammation drives catabolism and malnutrition, which in turn may perpetuate immune dysregulation. Our results thus provide supportive real-world evidence for the potential role of nutritional strategies as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy in maintaining remission, a notion previously suggested in studies of maintenance-phase enteral nutrition.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>78565</offset><text>Finally, and of direct importance to patients, the intervention group achieved significantly greater improvements in HRQoL, meeting thresholds for clinically meaningful change. Malnutrition profoundly impacts HRQoL through fatigue, functional impairment, and psychosocial strain. The individualized nutritional support and counseling provided in our pathway likely contributed to symptom alleviation and restored physical capacity, thereby enhancing daily functioning and social participation. This observation corroborates international reports on the positive impact of dietary management on overall well-being in IBD and underscores to clinicians that nutritional care is integral to achieving holistic treatment success, complementing the control of objective disease markers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>79346</offset><text>This study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective study, its non-randomized design indicates that the observed associations should not be interpreted as causal. Exposure to the nutritional pathway was determined by clinical practice, and despite multivariable adjustment, propensity score methods, and E-value analysis, unmeasured confounding (e.g., unrecorded socio-economic factors, nuanced disease severity, or health-seeking behaviors) likely persists. Second, selection bias and limited generalizability must be acknowledged, as only 39.8% (752/1,892) of the managed patient population was included. A substantial number of patients were excluded due to missing nutritional screening (n = 604), insufficient follow-up (&lt;3 months, n = 386), or missing key data (n = 150), patterns detailed in Supplementary Tables 5, 6; these individuals may differ systematically from the analytic cohort. Third, the intervention was a heterogeneous, pragmatic care package (with specific components and durations summarized in Supplementary Table 2) rather than a standardized protocol, and potential exposure misclassification in the control group (e.g., self-initiated supplement use, addressed in per-protocol sensitivity analyses referenced in Supplementary Table 3) likely biases effect estimates toward the null. Fourth, while design features (e.g., a strict 14-day exposure window) and a time-dependent Cox analysis were employed to address immortal time bias, residual time-related bias cannot be entirely excluded. Fifth, the need to harmonize two screening tools (NRS-2002 and MUST) into a single risk variable may introduce some misclassification of baseline nutritional status. Sixth, part of the observed benefit may be attributable to closer monitoring and more frequent contact embedded within the pathway, rather than nutritional improvement alone. Finally, the single-center setting and median follow-up of approximately 10 months limit the external validity and assessment of the long-term durability of the associations. Taken together, these limitations underscore that our findings represent evidence of association and highlight the need for prospective, randomized trials to establish causality.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>81566</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>81577</offset><text>Based on real-world clinical data from a single-center retrospective cohort, this study found that exposure to systematic nutritional risk stratification management was associated with better nutritional status, lower inflammatory markers and disease activity, reduced relapse and hospitalization rates, and improved quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. These findings support the hypothesis that integrating structured nutritional risk screening, individualized nutrition support, and dynamic reassessment into routine IBD care may contribute to improved clinical outcomes. However, because of the observational design, potential selection and information bias, exposure misclassification, and residual confounding, the observed associations should not be interpreted as definitive causal effects. Future prospective multicenter randomized studies and implementation research are needed to confirm these findings, clarify underlying mechanisms, and determine how best to incorporate nutritional risk stratification management into evidence-based, patient-centered IBD care pathways.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>82685</offset><text>Edited by: Weicheng Hu, Yangzhou University, China</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>82736</offset><text>Reviewed by: Ines Panjkota Krbavcic, University of Zagreb, Croatia</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>82803</offset><text>Lara Pires, Centro de Investigação de Montanha (CIMO), Portugal</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>82869</offset><text>Data availability statement</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>82897</offset><text>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>83019</offset><text>Ethics statement</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>83036</offset><text>The studies involving humans were approved by Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University.
