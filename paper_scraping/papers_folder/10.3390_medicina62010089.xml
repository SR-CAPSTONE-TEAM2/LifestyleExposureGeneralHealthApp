Additionally, we contrast the side effects of probiotics that are single-strain and multi-strain. Materials and Methods: PRISMA criteria were followed in the conduct and reporting of this study. The protocol for this review (CRD420251120965) was entered into PROSPERO. RCTs comparing probiotic usage to placebo or usual therapy in adult IBS patients were found using four online databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Ovid Medline, and the Cochrane Library. Review Manager was used for data synthesis and statistical analysis. Results: After screening 660 records, 16 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with 2823 IBS patients were included. Probiotics significantly reduced intestinal discomfort overall (MD: −93.9; 95% CI −133.1 to −54.7; p &lt; 0.00001) and the IBS-Severity Scoring System. Probiotics showed a clinically significant overall improvement (OR 1.71; 95% CI 1.26–2.33; p = 0.0006) when compared to a placebo. They were also well tolerated and did not increase adverse events. Conclusions: According to 16 RCTs, probiotics greatly lessen overall IBS symptoms, which enhances the quality of life and has global therapeutic implications. The findings support the use of probiotics as an effective and safe supplemental treatment for IBS patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1690</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1706</offset><text>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a widely prevalent, chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal discomfort, including bloating, alterations in bowel habits, and recurrent abdominal pain. This syndrome significantly affects patients’ health-related quality of life and imposes a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Despite its high prevalence, the multifactorial etiology of IBS encompassing abnormalities in gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, alterations in gut microbiota, psychological comorbidities such as anxiety and depression, genetic predisposition, and sex-specific factors remains incompletely understood. Central to the pathophysiology of IBS is a dysregulation of the gut–brain axis, which explains the frequent association of IBS with mood disorders and emphasizes the need for comprehensive, multidisciplinary management approaches.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2622</offset><text>Globally, the prevalence of IBS varies depending on the diagnostic criteria and population demographics. Some meta-analytical studies have indicated an overall prevalence of approximately 14.1%, with a female predominance (odds ratio 1.49) and psychological factors like stress playing significant contributory roles. Regionally, prevalence estimates may differ, with rates reported as high as 20.7% in Saudi Arabia. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on symptom criteria established by the Rome IV consensus, with IBS subtyped into four subgroups: constipation-predominant (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), mixed (IBS-M), and finally unclassified (IBS-U), which informs personalized management strategies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3338</offset><text>Current treatment modalities, including dietary modification, pharmacotherapy, and behavioral interventions, are limited by suboptimal efficacy, variable patient response, and the risk of adverse effects. Typically, dietary changes require careful supervision to prevent nutritional imbalances, as well as pharmacological agents that target isolated symptoms rather than addressing the overall manifestations of IBS. All of these limitations necessitate exploration into alternative therapeutic modalities.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3845</offset><text>Probiotics, defined as live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits to the host, have gained interest as potential modulators of the gut microbiota aiming to restore microbial homeostasis, enhance mucosal barrier function, reduce inflammation, and modulate the gut–brain axis. Specific probiotic strains, including Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, and Bifidobacterium longum, as well as multi-strain formulations, have demonstrated therapeutic potential, particularly in patients with moderate-to-severe IBS.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4445</offset><text>However, the wide heterogeneity in clinical trial designs, probiotic strains, dosages, administration durations, and outcome measures complicates the interpretation of efficacy. Most importantly, the existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses often do not stratify effects according to IBS subtypes, and limited long-term safety data constrain the development of evidence-based guidelines. This highlights a critical research gap concerning the identification of strain-, dose-, and subtype-specific probiotic efficacy and safety profiles.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4988</offset><text>Moreover, this systematic review and meta-analysis aim to rigorously evaluate the efficacy and safety of specific probiotic strains in managing distinct IBS subtypes, including IBS-C, IBS-D, IBS-M, and IBS-U, to establish evidence-based recommendations for personalized probiotic therapy. In line with this aim, the objectives of the review are to assess the effect of defined probiotic strains on global IBS symptom severity, including abdominal pain, bloating, and stool irregularities; evaluate the impact of probiotic interventions on IBS-related quality of life metrics; compare the therapeutic efficacy of single-strain versus multi-strain probiotic formulations; determine the influence of probiotic dosage and duration of treatment on clinical outcomes; synthesize safety data, including adverse events and treatment discontinuation rates associated with probiotic use in IBS patients; and explore subtype-specific responses to probiotics to identify optimal strain–subtype matching.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5982</offset><text>2.

MD was used only when all included studies within an outcome employed the same measurement scale (e.g., IBS-SSS). If future analyses require pooling studies using different scales, standardized mean difference (SMD) would be applied. For dichotomous outcomes, pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were estimated. A random-effects model (DerSimonian–Laird method) was applied when heterogeneity was substantial, while a fixed-effect model (Mantel–Haenszel method) was used for homogeneous data. Statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 statistic, with thresholds of 25%, 50%, and 75% representing low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively. A p-value &lt; 0.10 for the Chi-squared test indicated significant heterogeneity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>11697</offset><text>3.

The study was conducted in Korea, Italy, India, Germany, and South Korea, mostly involving individuals aged 16 to 70 years. The IBS subtypes varied between trials, with most focusing on constipation-predominant (IBS-C) or diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) forms, categorized according to Rome II, III or IV criteria. The number of male participants varied from 8 to 119 whilst female participants ranged from 18 to 317. All interventions involved the administration of oral probiotics, predominantly in capsule form, employing either single-strain or multi-strain formulations at daily dosages ranging from 5 × 109 to 1 × 1010 CFU, administered once daily for a period of 4 to 8 weeks. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between the treatment and control groups across the studies, as illustrated in Table 1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13115</offset><text>Based on our included randomized controlled trials, various probiotic strains exhibited notable effectiveness in mitigating symptoms of IBS, with differing impacts among IBS subtypes. Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus IDCC 3201 and several multispecies formulations (e.g., L. acidophilus, L. reuteri, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, B. lactis) markedly alleviated IBS-C symptoms, especially abdominal bloating, pain, and bowel habit satisfaction, while improving the quality of life and modulating gut microbiota composition. In cases of IBS-D, various strains of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (APsulloc 331261 GTB1, Jeju, Republic of Korea, CCFM8610 Jiangnan University Culture Collection Center (CCFM), Wuxi, China) and Lactobacillus gasseri BNR17 consistently alleviated symptom severity—particularly abdominal pain, distension, and diarrhea—while enhancing stool consistency, perceived stress, and quality of life, alongside beneficial alterations in microbiota and metabolic profiles. Bifidobacterium-based therapies (e.g., B. longum CECT 7347, B. infantis 35624, heat-inactivated B. bifidum MIMBb75) exhibited extensive symptom alleviation across IBS subtypes, enhancing abdominal pain, bloating, stool consistency, and anxiety, while being well tolerated. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 enhanced stomach discomfort and stool consistency across all subtypes, but one experiment indicated benefits mostly in IBS-C. In contrast, L. plantarum 299v, LCR35, and bacterial lysates produced variable or subtype-restricted advantages, as shown in Table 2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14670</offset><text>3.3.

Pooled studies under the random effect model were heterogeneous (I2 = 74%, p = 0.004). This inconsistency was likely influenced by the heterogeneous definitions used for “adequate global relief” across trials. Some studies assessed weekly symptom resolution whereas others used multi-week or composite criteria, leading to nonuniform thresholds for defining clinical improvement. These methodological differences may partially explain the discrepancy between this outcome and the more consistent findings presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19855</offset><text>This systematic review with meta-analysis combines results from 16 well-conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 2823 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The findings provide strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of oral probiotics in achieving IBS symptom control. The primary outcome demonstrates that probiotics are significantly more beneficial than placebo in improving overall symptoms, with a substantial reduction in IBS-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) scores (mean difference = −93.92; 95% CI: −133.11 to −54.73; p &lt; 0.00001). This improvement suggests a meaningful enhancement in patient quality of life. Consistent gains in global improvement—based on FDA-proposed responder definitions (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.26–2.33; p = 0.0006)—and low heterogeneity (I2 = 29%) further reinforce the reliability of these results. Additionally, reductions in abdominal discomfort support potential mechanisms involving gut–brain axis modulation, visceral sensitivity, or microbiome regulation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20892</offset><text>The results align with previous evidence supporting probiotic use in IBS. The favorable safety profile (OR = 0.77; p = 0.12; I2 = 7%) suggests no increased risk of adverse events compared with placebo. However, interpreting continuous outcomes remains challenging due to high heterogeneity in IBS-SSS (I2 = 71%) and intestinal discomfort (I2 = 84%). This variability may reflect clinical diversity related to heterogeneous IBS subtypes and the strain-specific nature of probiotic effects. Methodological differences including variable strain combinations, dosages, and formulations also contribute to inconsistencies in reported efficacy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21531</offset><text>Current clinical guidelines provide a nuanced context for interpreting these findings. The 2021 American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Clinical Guideline for the Management of IBS suggests against the routine use of probiotics for global IBS symptoms, citing low certainty of evidence and substantial heterogeneity across trials. This cautious recommendation reflects earlier inconsistencies in probiotic formulations, strain selection, and outcome reporting rather than a clear lack of therapeutic effect. Importantly, the present meta-analysis incorporates a larger and more contemporary evidence base, including higher-quality RCTs and standardized outcome measures, which may partially address the limitations highlighted in the ACG guideline. Our findings therefore contribute updated evidence that may inform future guideline revisions, particularly as probiotic research continues to evolve.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22434</offset><text>Recent evidence highlights the potential superiority of multi-strain and multispecies probiotic formulations. For example, Allegretti et al. (2025) reported significant improvements in bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort using a 24-strain synbiotic, suggesting that broader microbial diversity may enhance clinical benefits. These advanced diagnostic tools allow clinicians to characterize individual microbiome patterns before and after treatment, offering opportunities to tailor probiotic interventions. With microbiome assessment becoming increasingly integrated into clinical care, these approaches may refine future therapeutic strategies. A recent meta-analysis by Yang et al. (2024), which included 72 RCTs, demonstrated modest but significant improvements in global IBS symptoms and abdominal pain with probiotic use while similarly noting considerable heterogeneity and strain-specific effects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23343</offset><text>The clinical implications of this review are noteworthy. Probiotics demonstrate measurable symptom relief, good tolerability, and potential value for patients who do not respond adequately to first-line therapies. These findings support considering probiotics as a meaningful component of IBS management rather than solely an adjunctive option. At the same time, the growing evidence base for multi-strain and personalized probiotic therapy underscores the need for updated clinical frameworks that account for strain specificity, microbiome profiles, and biological mechanisms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23922</offset><text>Future research should focus on large, well-designed RCTs evaluating specific strains in defined IBS subtypes; mechanistic studies addressing microbial changes, SCFA pathways, and mucosal barrier effects; and long-term follow-up to understand sustained benefits. Despite some limitations, including heterogeneity and incomplete reporting, this review provides robust evidence supporting probiotic use while highlighting the need for more precise and personalized therapeutic approaches.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>24409</offset><text>5. Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24424</offset><text>This systematic review and meta-analysis study of 16 randomized controlled trials involving 2823 patients with irritable bowel syndrome provides robust evidence supporting the efficacy of oral probiotics for symptom management. The results demonstrated that probiotic therapy significantly reduced total symptom severity and meaningful global improvement compared with placebo, with additional benefits observed across key symptom domains (abdominal pain and diarrhea). Importantly, probiotics demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no significant increase in adverse events relative to placebo.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25027</offset><text>Taken together, all of these findings indicate that probiotics represent a safe and effective therapeutic option for improving symptoms in overall patients who have IBS. However, given the variability in probiotic strains, dosages, and study durations, further well-designed, large-scale trials are warranted to establish optimal regimens and confirm long-term benefits.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>25398</offset><text>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

The probiotics also showed a marked effect on reducing mucus in stool and urgency.	 	Liu et al., 2021 	Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial	China	Single-strain	Powder	1 × 1010 CFU/day	Once daily	8 weeks	Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610 significantly alleviated IBS-D clinical symptoms (reducing severity and bloating and improving bowel habit satisfaction), enhanced quality of life, and reversed gut microbiota dysbiosis by increasing beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria and decreasing bloating-related Methanobrevibacter, all while being well tolerated and safe.	 	Spiller et al., 2015 	Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial; multi-center	France 	Single-strain 	Capsule	1000 mg per day (equivalent to 8 × 109 colony forming units (CFU)/g) 	Once daily	12 weeks	The study found no overall benefit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae I-3856 for general IBS symptoms. However, it demonstrated a significant improvement in abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating in the IBS-C subgroup compared to placebo.	 	Gayathri et al., 2020 	Randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial	India	Single-strain 	capsule	2 × 109 CFU	Twice daily	8 weeks	The study demonstrated that Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 significantly reduced abdominal pain and improved stool consistency across all IBS subgroups (IBS-C, IBS-D, IBS-M) compared to placebo. It was well tolerated with no serious adverse events.	 	Dapoigny et al., 2012 	Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial; pilot study	France	Single-strain	capsule	2 × 108 CFU	Once daily (3 capsules together in fasting state)	4 weeks	The results indicated that LCR35 did not produce a statistically significant improvement in global IBS symptoms. Nonetheless, within the IBS-D subgroup, LCR35 was associated with meaningful decreases in overall symptom intensity and abdominal pain, showed a greater proportion of treatment responders, and demonstrated good tolerability across all subgroups.	 	Whorwell et al., 2006 	Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial	United Kingdom	single-strain	capsule	1 × 106, 1 × 108, or 1 × 1010 CFU per dose	Once daily	4 weeks	The study found that Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 at a dose of 1 × 108 CFU significantly relieved multiple IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain and bloating, and improved overall IBS relief and bowel habit satisfaction in women with IBS. It also normalized bowel movement frequency at the extremes and was well tolerated across IBS-C, IBS-D, and IBS-A subgroups.	 	Moeen-Ul-Haq et al., 2022 	Randomized controlled trial (RCT)	Pakistan	Single-strain	Capsule	5 × 1010 CFU	Once daily	4 weeks	The study concluded no significant overall efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v in improving IBS symptoms compared to placebo. However, sub-analysis showed significant reduction in abdominal pain severity for IBS-C and IBS-D subgroups at the end of therapy with L. plantarum 299v.	 	Andresen et al., 2020	A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial	Germany 	Multi-strain	Capsule	1 × 109 non-viable B. bifidum HI-MIMBb75 cells per day. Two capsules were taken orally once a day	Once a day	8 weeks	The study demonstrated that heat-inactivated Bifidobacterium bifidum mimbb75 (SYN-HI-001) significantly improved overall IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, and global relief, compared to placebo. It also showed subtype-specific benefits, such as increased bowel movements in IBS-C and improved stool consistency in IBS-D, and was well tolerated.	 	Mack et al., 2022 	A phase IV, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center (30 study sites), parallel group study	Germany 	Multi-strain 	Oral drops	1.5-4.5 × 107 E. coli and 1.5-4.5 × 107 E. faecalis per mL. The dosage schedule was 10 drops (0.71 mL) 3×/day during week one, 20 drops (1.42 mL) 3×/day during week two, and 30 drops (2.14 mL) 3×/day during week three, with maintenance dosing of 30 drops 3×/day.	Three times a day 	26 weeks 	The study found that a bacterial lysate was not effective across all IBS subtypes for primary global or abdominal pain endpoints. However, post hoc and sensitivity analyses suggested potential benefits in the IBS-D subgroup, showing a trend for improved abdominal pain response, reduction in diarrhea, and a higher responder rate (IBS-AP75). The treatment was well tolerated.	 	</text></passage></document>
