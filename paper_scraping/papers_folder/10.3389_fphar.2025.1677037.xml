Recent evidence suggests that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may be involved in the development of IBS symptoms. Indeed, the GABAergic system exerts many gastrointestinal functions, such as modulation of visceral pain, intestinal motility, intestinal barrier integrity and immune response. GABA receptors and transporters are present and may influence intestinal functions at multiple levels: in the central nervous system, in the enteric nervous system and at the gut epithelial level. Furthermore, the gut microbiota is capable of producing GABA. This may also suggest a direct link between. intestinal microbiota composition and GABAergic tone within the microbiota gut-brain axis. Confirming the involvement of GABAergic dysregulation in IBS, altered GABA signaling and reduced GABA levels have been observed in this disease, especially in diarrhea-predominant subtypes. This review explores the possible roles of GABAergic dysregulation in IBS pathogenesis across multiple levels: in the central nervous system circuits, at the intestinal level, and in the microbiota-gut-brain axis interactions. Moreover, preclinical and limited clinical data regarding possible therapeutic approaches targeting the GABAergic system in IBS are discussed in the review. These include GABA receptor modulators, dietary supplements, probiotics producers of GABA and novel combinations such as GABA–Melissa officinalis. However, despite promising results, current evidence on these approaches is limited and mainly based on animal models. Therefore, randomized clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of GABA-based products in IBS management.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1902</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1915</offset><text>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of gut-brain interaction characterized by persistent or intermittent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits.

GAD exists as two isoforms: GAD1 and GAD2. Ninety percent of the synthesized GABA is subsequently degraded by GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), present in both neurons and glial cells. After its release, GABA is taken up from the synaptic cleft by the GABA transporter (GAT). Indeed, the clearance of extracellular GABA is not susceptible to enzymatic breakdown, but it is solely dependent on diffusion and uptake by the GAT, which can be expressed in several brain cell types, such as astrocytes and neurons.

However, when analyzing the difference between the fold change of GAD2 and GABA-T reduction, a tenfold greater reduction in GAD2 was observed compared to that of GABA-T reduction.

Indeed, GABA can control the excitatory pathways in the CNS, and the loss of GABA-producing cells may alter the balance of excitation and inhibition. The balance between glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) tone is essential for normal neuronal functioning. Guo et al. demonstrated that the activation of GABAergic neurons projecting from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) could elicit visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal motility dysfunction, and may produce anxiety-like behaviours in mouse models. Furthermore, these authors demonstrated that the activation of the GABAergic neurons led to an increase in histamine and serotonin (5-HT) levels in mice colonic tissues. These responses seem to be mediated by GABA-AR: the administration of Bicuculline (a GABA-AR antagonist), caused a reversion of these effects. Guo et al., in support of their studies, also reported that in their mice model of IBS, the chemogenetic inhibition of GABAergic neurons projecting from ACC to LHA was able to alleviate anxiety-like behaviours, improved visceral hypersensitivity and intestinal dysfunction. The central role of ACC in the genesis of IBS symptoms was also highlighted by Li et al., who confirmed that activation of GABAergic neurons in ACC led to a decrease in mechanical pain thresholds in naive mouse models. Furthermore, other studies confirmed that the activation of these GABAergic neurons was associated with anxiety-depression symptoms. The ACC is indeed closely associated with mood disorders related to GI disease and to visceral pain, while the LHA is a brain region that responds to noxious stimuli, and plays a role in controlling pain-related behavioral responses. Given their important roles, these areas and their GABAergic connections may be altered by chronic abdominal pain and may be involved in symptom maintenance and in the genesis of psychological comorbidities, which have a higher prevalence in IBS. Supporting these hypotheses, patients with chronic pelvic pain appear to have lower levels of GABA in the ACC.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10377</offset><text>Apart from the ACC-LHA GABAergic projections, other possible mechanisms involving GABAergic pathways in the CNS have been linked to IBS-like symptoms. In detail, Li et al. demonstrated, in a long-term water avoidance stress-induced IBS mouse model, the presence of increased GABAergic projections to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. These GABAergic projections were able to inhibit the firing rate of neurons in the PVN and, as a consequence, decreased the expression and release of oxytocin. Exogenous oxytocin has been demonstrated to improve gut motility and decrease abdominal withdrawal reflex scores. Therefore, inhibition of oxytocin by adaptive GABAergic projection in the PVN could be another important etiologic feature in IBS mediated by GABAergic dysregulation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11173</offset><text>Spinal GABAergic circuits modulate the brain’s processing of peripheral pain. GABA-AR can be divided into synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors based on their location in the synapse. Synaptic GABA-AR generally mediate classical phasic inhibition, whereas extrasynaptic GABA-AR produce tonic conductance when activated by low concentrations of GABA. Peripheral and spinal extrasynaptic α5-GABA-AR have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of pain pathways in a variety of chronic pain models. For instance, intrathecal administration of α5-GABA-AR inverse agonist L-655,708 attenuates chronic pain. Therefore, extrasynaptic GABA-AR play distinct roles in pain pathways and further studies are needed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11899</offset><text>Spinal GABA AR activation decreases spinal projection neuronal activity in a rat model of post-surgical pain, which was linked to less mechanical hypersensitivity but not to resting pain.

A better understanding of the modality-specific processing in the spinal cord between mechanical hypersensitivity and rest in the context of post-surgical pain could provide significant information for preventing its chronicity, even in other chronic pain conditions such as IBS.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>12661</offset><text>Enteric nervous system (ENS) and intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB): nociception, permeability and inflammation</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12774</offset><text>GABA seems to play several roles at the intestinal level such as the control of motility and cell proliferation.

It has been reported that a significant contributing component to the pathophysiology of diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) is low-grade mucosal inflammation. In this regard, the activation of GABA-AR in the colon seems to be linked to intestinal inflammation. Indeed, mice that experienced stress early-life stress showed markedly changed colonic contractility and impaired barrier function mediated by GABA-AR. Furthermore, in a mouse model, restraint stress led to colon inflammation. This effect could be mediated by the GABA-AR subunit α3 gene (Gabra3), as demonstrated by the fact that Gabra3 expression and inflammation can be increased by stress in the colon of mouse. Supporting this evidence, Seifi et al. reported that an α3-GABA-AR agonist was able to induce colonic inflammation in vitro, while α1/4/5-GABA-AR ligands were able to decrease the expression of inflammatory markers in the colon. These mechanisms could be relevant to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14791</offset><text>Additionally, some studies have shown that eliciting GABAergic signaling, particularly through the activation of GABA-AR, reduced the overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in HT-29 cells (a cell line from a white, female colorectal adenocarcinoma patient) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), increased the diversity of the gut microbiota, and may modify the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells mediated by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, indicating a potential protective role in certain types of infective diarrhea.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15326</offset><text>Although less evidence is available regarding GABA-BR’s role in the MGB axis, it has been reported that its activation led to significant anti-inflammatory effects, that eased LPS-induced intestinal inflammation in mice, a decrease in oxidative stress, an enrichment of the gut microbiota with increased levels of beneficial species, and a balance in excitatory pathways that may be associated to stress, anxiety or mood disorders. Furthermore, GABAergic neurons may influence gut motility through the modulation of smooth muscles in the gut, thereby affecting intestinal transit time. GABA also modulates the secretion of fluids and electrolytes in the intestine, has been shown that the GABAergic pathway is involved in transmitting signals of pain and discomfort from the gut to the brain.

Since post-inflammatory visceral hypersensitivity is caused by enteric barrier and immune response alterations, a treatment capable of restoring the intestinal mucosa and of indirectly limiting inflammation and modulating the immune response could be the key. In this regard, GABA exerts multiple beneficial effects at the intestinal level by modulating immune-inflammatory response, acting also on cytokine production, and by strengthening IEB.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16883</offset><text>In a recent preclinical study, Lucarini et al. demonstrated that treatment with GABA-Melissa officinalis can counteract the onset and persistence of visceral hypersensitivity in a rat model of 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS) induced colitis.

Although the tested drug showed no significant effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, GABA-M. officinalis combination helped restore the integrity of the IEB, as demonstrated by lower levels of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and increased expression of claudin-1, and reduced the activation of both enteric and spinal glial cells, which is linked to chronic pain.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17748</offset><text>Post-inflammatory visceral hypersensitivity is also supported by the sensitization of nociceptors in the colon. As the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA plays a key role in regulating pain signaling by acting directly on different types of receptors (i.e., GABA-AR and GABA-BR) (Figure 2). In a preclinical study, diazepam was shown to decrease visceromotor response (VMR) in both dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated and control mice by modulating of peripheral GABA-AR signaling. When inflammation is present, the colon’s extracellular GABA levels drop. In the CNS, inhibition of GABA-AR may contribute to inflammatory hypersensitivity. Hence, visceral pain might result from decreased GABA-mediated suppression of nociceptive signals from the colon directed to the CNS. Furthermore, Coleman and Spiller reported that GABA-BR agonists may be a possible therapeutic target to alleviate pain in IBS patients. It was subsequently demonstrated that activation of GABA-BR produces anti-nociceptive effects in a rat model of mechanically induced visceral pain.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">fphar-16-1677037-g002.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>18812</offset><text>Roles of different GABA receptors relevant to the pathophysiology of IBS.

These differential tRNA-derived small RNAs, beyond representing potential biomarkers of IBS-D, have been shown to be potentially involved in some key signaling pathways, such as GABAergic synapse and TNF-α.

They observed a downregulation of both GABA-BR subunits (i.e., GABA-B1R, and GABA-B2R) in IBS-D patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, authors demonstrated that GABA-BR function differed between patients with IBS-D and UC, reflecting the distinct inflammatory profiles of these two disorders. The same authors in a different study showed an increased expression of GABA-B2R in colonic mucosal biopsies of UC patients. It was found that another reason for the reduced GABA levels in IBS-D patients was the increased expression of the GABA transporter 2 (i.e., GAT-2), involved in GABA uptake and subsequent reduction of local GABA concentration.

This bidirectional communication modulates intestinal motility, immunity, permeability and secretions. In the last decade, researchers have shown that this bidirectional communication is further complicated by its interaction with the gut microbiota, so today the concept of the MGB axis has been introduced. Indeed, it is well documented that alterations in the MGB axis affect both the IEB and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, playing an important factor in the pathogenesis of both GI diseases (such as IBS) and CNS diseases. There are five main ways in which the gut microbiota and the brain can communicate: the gut–brain neural network pathways, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, the gut immune system, the neurotransmitters synthesized directly by the gut microbiota (e.g., GABA), and the barrier pathways (i.e., IEB and blood-brain barrier). The communication through all these components can be bidirectional, so GI signals can influence the CNS and CNS signals can alter GI function. Overall, the CNS can interfere with the intestinal microenvironment by modulating intestinal motility and neuroendocrine pathways. On the other hand, the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the MGB axis due to its interactions with the immune system, IEB and/or ENS-vagus nerve pathways. Certain intestinal bacterial species can directly stimulate enterochromaffin cells to produce various neurotransmitters (e.g., 5-HT), or neuropeptides (e.g., peptide YY, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptides-1 and -2, and substance P). Moreover, specific bacterial metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids, vitamins or neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA or 5-HT) can pass across the IEB, flow into the bloodstream and reach the CNS.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24765</offset><text>In IBS, GABA can affect gut function and brain activity in IBS, assisting in regulating their connection.

This was associated with changes in the expression of GABA receptors in specific areas of the brain. Moreover, a more recent study reported an increase in brain GABA in mice after supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB-1. From a mechanistic perspective, it has been suggested that the vagus nerve is a significant route whereby beneficial bacteria in the gut could influence behaviours related to anxiety and depression.

Based on these pathophysiological data, some studies have evaluated the efficacy of GABA-producing probiotic strains in modulating visceral nociception, mainly in preclinical settings. The human gut commensal Bifidobacterium dentium produces a significant quantity of GABA, and oral supplementation has been shown in vivo to regulate sensory neuron activity in a rat fecal retention model of visceral hypersensitivity. Moreover, a selenium-enriched Bifidobacterium (Se-B. longum DD98) was shown to act on the MGB axis by relieving the intestinal symptoms of IBS, reducing intestinal permeability and inflammation, and regulating mood-related behaviours in a mice model of stress-induced IBS. This was associated with the upregulation of 5-HT, GABA, neuropeptide Y, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which are indicators closely related to mood and MGB axis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28561</offset><text>Laroute et al. demonstrated that L. lactis NCDO2118, a high GABA producer, exerts visceral anti-hypersensitivity effects due to its high GAD activity in an acute stress IBS-like rat model. Conversely, L. lactis NCDO2727, a low-level GABA-producing strain, despite similar genes for GABA metabolism, had no antinociceptive effect in vivo, nor did the NCDO2118 strain when unable to produce GABA. The beneficial effect observed for L. lactis NCDO2118 was therefore attributed to the production of GABA in the GI lumen and its subsequent stimulation of the GABA-BR. The same group showed that L. lactis CNCM I-5388 had higher intracellular GAD activity, resulting in increased GABA production under the same in vitro conditions as strain NCDO2118. Additionally, L. lactis CNCM I-5388 showed greater anti-visceral hypersensitivity efficacy both in terms of onset of action and partial persistence of effects after 5-day treatment interruption in the same acute stress rat model compared to strain NCDO2118. Finally, the same group showed that anti-visceral hypersensitivity properties were also mediated by ethanol-inactivated Lactococcus lactis CNCM I-5388 through an active GAD enzyme, resulting in increased GABA levels in the stomach in the same IBS rat model. These preclinical findings in animal models suggest that GABA-producing bacteria in both viable and non-viable forms might represent a potential treatment for alleviating IBS symptoms in humans as well, especially considering their effect on visceral hypersensitivity. Therefore, the gut microbiota may play an important role in positively modulating the stress response, and visceral GI nociception by acting on the host’s GABAergic signalling. However, clinical evidence is still lacking.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>30315</offset><text>Gabaergic agents as a possible therapeutic approach in IBS</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30374</offset><text>The management of IBS remains a challenge for physicians. Conventional treatments for IBS primarily target predominant stool pattern (e.g., opioid agonists such as loperamide, and laxatives such as polyethylene glycol) offering limited efficacy in addressing symptoms like bloating and abdominal pain. At present, there are several management strategies for IBS, including dietary approaches (e.g., low Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides, and Polyols diet), antispasmodic agents, antihistamines (e.g., ebastine), 5- HT3 antagonists (e.g., ondansetron), mixed opioid agonists/antagonists (i.e., eluxadoline), bile acid sequestrants (e.g., colestyramine), ileal bile acid transporter agents (e.g., elobixibat), microbiota-modulating treatments (e.g., prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, non-absorbable antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation), mucoprotectants, gut-brain neuromodulators (e.g., TCAs, SSRIs, and SNRIs), brain-gut behavioral treatments (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy), and psychological therapies. However, these therapies frequently produce only partial and inadequate effects, most likely because to the complicated and yet poorly understood pathophysiology of IBS. The increased knowledge of the role of the GABAergic signaling system in IBS could offer opportunities for innovative gut-brain neuromodulators. For instance, targeting GABA receptors with specific agonists or modulators could provide new perspectives for managing abdominal pain and psychological symptoms associated with IBS.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31906</offset><text>We have several drugs acting through the modulation of GABA that could potentially be useful for IBS treatment (Table 1). Gabapentin and pregabalin (generally used to treat neuropathic pain) are two α2δ auxiliary protein ligands of voltage-gated calcium channels. Their full mechanism of action is not yet understood. Although they do not bind to GABA receptors and have no effects on GABA production or degradation, they are structurally similar to GABA. Several studies have demonstrated the anti-hyperalgesic effects of gabapentin and pregabalin on more severe GI symptoms. Gabapentin was able to improve pain and anxiety in mice, and reduced the cerebral nociceptive response to colorectal distension, but its use is limited by its side effects (i.e., hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity). In a clinical study, forty patients with IBS-D were randomly assigned to a 5-day treatment with gabapentin (i.e., 300 and 600 mg/day), observing an increase in rectal sensory thresholds resulting from a reduction in rectal sensitivity to distension and enhanced rectal compliance. Pregabalin, for its analgesic and anxiety-relieving effects, was approved by FDA for the treatment of fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain. Pre‐clinical studies suggest that pregabalin is effective visceral analgesic. Houghton et al. showed that pregabalin increased distension sensory thresholds (i.e., first sensation, desire to defecate, and pain) to normal levels in IBS patients with rectal hypersensitivity. In addition, the authors reported that pregabalin was generally well tolerated, except for mild dizziness and somnolence. It was subsequently shown that pregabalin did not reduce colonic pain related to distension in patients with IBS-C.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>33635</offset><text>Medications potentially affecting GABA pathways divided in clinical and preclinical studies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

Although pregabalin could be beneficial for IBS abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea, it did not improve quality of life, anxiety and depression. The different efficacy profile of pregabalin among IBS subtypes may be due to the low prevalence of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS-C. PD-217014 is a novel α2δ ligand with visceral analgesic activity that is potentially more potent than gabapentin and pregabalin. It has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the visceral hypersensitivity induced by an intra-colonic injection of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid in rats. However, a recent large-scale randomized clinical trial showed no significant efficacy of PD-217014 compared to placebo in reducing abdominal pain/discomfort in IBS patients. These conflicting results on the efficacy of α2δ ligands in the IBS treatment need to be investigated by further studies on large samples, also to assess their safety profile.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38800</offset><text>Further potential drugs able to act through GABA modulation are topiramate, which acts on GABA-activated chloride channels, diazepam, by modulation of peripheral GABA-AR signaling, baclofen (i.e., a GABA-BR agonist), and CGP7930 (i.e., a GABA-BR positive allosteric modulator), currently used only in experimental settings. Despite being a promising target for IBS treatment, activation of GABA-AR has been linked to serious adverse effects, including aggravation of severe colitis. Other alternative treatments for GABA-dependent GI symptoms are the use of probiotics, natural (e.g., B. dentium ATCC 27678) or genetically modified (e.g., B. longum with a plant derived GAD gene) GABA producers, or GABA containing functional foods (e.g., fermented goats’ milk and enriched bioactive yogurt). Indeed, studies on ingested bacteria have shown that several probiotic bacterial genera have beneficial effects in relieving the symptoms of IBS patients. Despite some growing evidence, the efficacy of probiotics in IBS is limited in clinical practice by the uncertainty associated with the wide biological variability of bacterial strains. Especially regarding bacteria producing GABA, evidence from clinical trial are really limited. In a recent randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, the efficacy of administering Bifidobacterium adolescentis PRL 2019, a GABA-producing strain, was tested in a paediatric population with IBS according to Rome IV criteria. Bifidobacterium adolescentis PRL2019 was able to reduce the severity and frequency of IBS symptoms in children, with positive effect on bowel habits in patients with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40465</offset><text>Finally, in order to achieve beneficial effects at digestive level, another possible strategy may be direct GABA supplementation.

Furthermore, it was able to improve the IEB in a rat models of IBS. Melissa officinalis may enhance the therapeutic effects of GABA, either by inhibiting its metabolism in vivo or by directly influencing inflammation and nociception.

However, genetic, immune, environmental, inflammatory, neurological and psychological factors may play a crucial role in MGB axis dysregulation leading to visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal epithelial barrier disruption, intestinal dysbiosis and changes in colonic motility. In recent years, emerging evidence has pointed out a possible involvement of GABAergic signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of IBS. Indeed, GABA seems to be involved in the regulation of many GI functions, acting both at a central and peripheral level. Therefore, GABAergic dysregulation may exert different pathogenetic effects on different components of IBS depending on its site of action (CNS, peripheral or MGB axis).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41915</offset><text>At the CNS level, GABA seems to be involved and to modulate some crucial IBS aspects mainly linked to visceral sensitivity and mood disorders. Indeed, some areas of the CNS, such as the ACC, LHA and GABAergic projections from the former to the latter, may be altered by chronic abdominal pain and may play a role in symptom maintenance and the genesis of psychological comorbidities. Supporting the close connection between these areas and IBS- psychological comorbidities, ACC is also a crucial hub for emotion and cognition, and it has been closely related to mood disorders associated with GI diseases. Indeed, inflammation and chronic GI pain have been demonstrated to be primary drivers that induce brain remodeling, especially in the ACC. In this regard, GABAergic neurons in ACC seem to play a pivotal role also in anxiety/depression like emotions and pain management.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>42791</offset><text>In contrast, at the gut level, a GABAergic dysregulation seems to be mainly implicated in the development of dysmotility, alteration in cell proliferation, regulation of GI immune system and epithelial barrier impairment. Additionally, at gut level, some studies have shown that eliciting GABAergic signaling may have a modulatory effect on the diversity of the gut-microbiota. GABA, thus, appears to be able to modulate various pathogenetic mechanisms of IBS, and a therapy that targets this system might be able to act on multiple IBS mechanisms simultaneously.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43355</offset><text>Therefore, in light of emerging evidence on the role of GABA, new therapies targeting GABAergic pathways may be reasonable. However, the majority of evidence regarding therapeutic approaches based on GABA to treat visceral pain, IBD-related abdominal pain or IBS has so far been evaluated only on animal models and therefore there are currently no approved or recommended therapies targeting the GABAergic system. In this regard, only the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for IBS mention pregabalin as a possible new therapy for visceral pain based on two randomized clinical trials, underlying however that further evidence is needed before considering this medication for IBS. Drug acting on GABA pathways (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin and PD-217014) have shown in few clinical trials to improve intestinal sensitivity and IBS symptoms, especially in patients with diarrhea and data are conflicting for other subtypes of IBS. Furthermore, many drugs were tested only on preclinical settings and not on IBS patients (Table 1). Therefore, there is a pressing need on new high-quality evidence from clinical trials supporting the interesting data emerged from the preclinical studies. Regarding the best target to modulate (e.g., GABA-AR vs. GABA-BR vs. other targets) there is currently no knowledge on this subject. It is plausible that GABAergic modulation mediated by GABA-B receptors may be more effective in modulating visceral hypersensitivity in IBS-D than in other subtypes of IBS, considering the known pathophysiological differences between the various subtypes of IBS.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>44949</offset><text>On the other hand, another crucial source of GABA is the one derived from the gut-microbiota production or the diet-derived GABA. Indeed, several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that GABA-producing bacteria in both viable and non-viable forms might represent a potential treatment for alleviating IBS symptoms, especially considering their effect on visceral hypersensitivity. However, also regarding these products, there are currently few clinical trials in human evaluating the effects of GABA-producing bacteria in IBS (Table 1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45502</offset><text>Studies are also lacking regarding the difference in GABA supplementation through the diet and endogenous production of GABA. In this context, the recent study by Lucarini et al. on a rat model of post-inflammatory IBS, points out a possible encouraging therapeutic role of the supplementation of a combination of GABA and M. officinalis in treating IBS. However, this supplementation has not yet been tested in clinical practice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45933</offset><text>These findings collectively support the notion that targeting GABAergic pathways could offer a promising therapeutic strategy for managing both the inflammatory and pain-related symptoms of IBS (Figure 1). The many available preclinical studies are essential because only through understanding the bacterial metabolism of GABA, the variability between strains, and the bioavailability of GABA will be possible to translate probiotic or postbiotic therapy to humans. Our hope is that in future we will have high-quality evidence supporting the effective usage of GABA-acting or GABA-based products to treat IBS.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46544</offset><text>In conclusion, emerging evidence underscores the important role of GABA in the pathophysiology of IBS, particularly in relation to visceral pain and the MGB axis dysregulation. A better understanding of the intricate relationships between GABAergic dysfunction, microbial influences, and IBS symptoms is essential for developing targeted therapies based on pathophysiological evidence. In this regard, continued research is warranted to bridge existing gaps in knowledge and enhance the clinical management of this complex disorder. Future randomized clinical trials involving GABA-based products are advisable to assess whether it may provide a new therapeutic chance for IBS patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>47231</offset><text> Edited by: Ludovico Abenavoli, Magna Græcia University, Italy</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>47295</offset><text> Reviewed by: Yiming Meng, China Medical University, China</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>47354</offset><text> Gitanjali Deokar, Bhujbal Knowledge City, India</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>47403</offset><text> Chuda Chittasupho, Chiang Mai University, Thailand</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>47455</offset><text>Abbreviations: 5-HT, serotonin; ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; CNS, central nervous system; DNBS, 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; DSS, dextran sodium sulfate; ENS, enteric nervous system; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABA-AR, ionotropic GABA receptor; GABA-BR, metabotropic GABA receptor; GABA-R, GABA receptor; GABA-T, GABA-transaminase; GAD, glutamic acid decarboxylase; GAT, GABA transporter; GI, gastrointestinal; GPCR, G-protein coupled receptors; IBD, inflammatory bowel diseases; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; IBS-C, constipation-predominant; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; IBS-D, diarrhea-predominant IBS; IBS-M, mixed stool pattern IBS; IEB, intestinal epithelial barrier; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; LBP, lipopolysaccharide binding protein; LHA, lateral hypothalamic area; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MGB, microbiota-gut-brain; PVN, paraventricular nucleus; UC, ulcerative colitis; VMR, visceromotor response.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>48388</offset><text>Author contributions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>48409</offset><text>CL: Conceptualization, Methodology, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing.
