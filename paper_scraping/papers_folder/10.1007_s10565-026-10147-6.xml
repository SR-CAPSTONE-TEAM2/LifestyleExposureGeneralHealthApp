Recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) exert anticancer effects and may hold promise as therapeutic adjuvants. In this study, we investigated the potential of a physiologically relevant mixture of SCFAs to enhance the efficacy of 5-FU against CRC. Using a combination of 2D monolayer cultures, 3D models, and the in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, we demonstrated that SCFAs positively affect the antitumor effects of low-dose 5-FU. SCFAs contributed to the inhibition of CRC cell growth, proliferation, survival, and migration, with an overall increase of the anti-tumour effects observed across the different models. The combined treatment led to a significant reduction in tumour size in the CAM assay, contributing for an improvement of the effects of 5-FU alone. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that physiologically relevant SCFA combinations can be harnessed to improve the therapeutic index of 5-FU in CRC, in a context-dependent manner. These findings support the development of microbiota-targeted co-adjuvant strategies to optimize CRC chemotherapy, reduce treatment toxicity, and improve patient outcomes, which is important given the clinical interest in microbiome-chemotherapy interactions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1754</offset><text>Graphical Abstract</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1773</offset><text>Supplementary Information</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1799</offset><text>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10565-026-10147-6.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1891</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1904</offset><text>The World Health Organization reported that colorectal cancer (CRC) has become one of the most common malignant tumours worldwide, responsible for approximately 1.93 million new cases and 930 600 cancer-related deaths, ranking the third in terms of incidence and the second in terms of mortality in 2020 (Sung et al.; Observatory). While the high incidence rates can be explained by several lifestyle factors, such as a low-fibre diet, smoking, lack of exercise and obesity, the high mortality rates are associated with the late diagnosis and therapeutic challenges, namely the resistance to chemotherapy, severe side effects and lack of effective therapies for advance-stages tumours (Sung et al.; Rawla et al.; Oppelt et al.; Gomes et al.).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2647</offset><text>Currently, when a patient is diagnosed with CRC, there are several therapeutic options clinically available. In early stages of the disease, the first line of treatment consists in achieving the complete removal of the tumour and metastases by surgery (Xie et al.). However, when the cancer is diagnosed at an advanced stage with metastases, the best option is to shrink the tumour, inhibiting the tumour spread and growth by chemotherapy or, in rectal cancers, radiotherapy (Xie et al.). Common chemotherapeutic approaches include both single-agent therapy, which is mainly fluoropyrimidine fluorouracil-based, and multiple-agent regimens containing several drugs, including oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and capecitabine (Xie et al.). Immunotherapy with the PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab, and targeted therapy regimens using biological agents, namely bevacizumab, panitumumab, cetuximab, ramucirumab and regorafenib are also alternatives used in the treatment of metastatic CRC. However, despite all the advances regarding the available therapeutic options, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) remains the most used chemotherapeutic agent, both as a single strategy or in combination with other drugs, and so the need for new strategies to increase its efficacy is of extreme importance (Xie et al.).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3945</offset><text>The recent recognition of the colon microbiota as a hallmark of cancer revealed the impact that these microorganisms can have in the protection against cancer development, with a clear role in malignant progression and response to therapy (Xie et al.). It is already known that the adoption of specific dietary patterns, such as the ingestion of dairy products and fibres, modulates the intestinal microbiota composition towards a high percentage of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing bacteria (Observatory; Rawla et al.; Oppelt et al.; Gomes et al.). In this regard, in the past few years, the individual role of acetate, butyrate, and propionate in the regulation of different biological processes has been investigated, in order to develop new alternatives for CRC treatment. Considering the effects against CRC cells, our group has already reported that acetate plays an anticarcinogenic role, since it is able to inhibit CRC cell proliferation and induce cell death by apoptosis, with promotion of lysosome membrane permeabilization (LMP) and release of cathepsin D (Gomes et al.; Marques et al.; Ferro et al.; Oliveira et al.). Butyrate has the ability to inhibit cell differentiation, induce cell death by apoptosis, and block cell proliferation by promoting cell-cycle arrest (Gomes et al.; Li et al.; Queirós et al.; Donohoe et al.; Zhang et al.; Fung et al.). Propionate suppresses CRC development by inducing anti survival mechanisms namely apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy. In addition, this metabolite is also able to inhibit inflammatory responses and to modulate histone acetylation (Gomes et al.; Tedelind et al.; Hague et al.). The individual role of acetate, butyrate and propionate has been widely studied during the past decade; however, the understanding of their combined effects was only recently demonstrated for the first time by our research group (Gomes et al.). The combination of three SCFA at the ratio found at human physiological conditions (60% acetate, 15% butyrate and 25% propionate) revealed to have potential therapeutic effects against CRC cells (Gomes et al.). When in mixture, SCFA exhibit an additive profile, being able to inhibit cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, with higher specificity to CRC cells rather than non-tumorigenic cells (Gomes et al.). The study reported, for the first time, that SCFA in combination impact the regulation of several biological processes (Gomes et al.), and inhibit CRC cell proliferation in a more significant way than individually.(Gomes et al.). Moreover, the combination of these metabolites is able to induce apoptotic cell death with lysosome membrane permeabilization and consequent cytosolic acidification (Gomes et al.). The reported antitumoral effects induced by the microbiota-derived SCFA suggest that they can potentially contribute to the development of new strategies for CRC therapeutics based on the increase in the SCFA levels. In this regard, the general aim of the present work is to investigate the possibility of using SCFA as co-adjuvants to 5-FU, the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in CRC treatment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>7071</offset><text>Material and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7092</offset><text>Cell lines and culture conditions</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">Tab1.xml</infon><infon key="id">Tab1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>7126</offset><text>Most relevant genetic phenotypes for RKO and HCT-15 cell lines (Berg et al.)</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">Tab1.xml</infon><infon key="id">Tab1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

Firstly, the impact of the SCFA mixture on the 5-FU effects on colony formation was evaluated through a clonogenic assay. By using sub-lethal IC10 concentrations and removing the drugs before colony expansion, we minimized acute cell death during the assay. The results indicated that, in the RKO cell line, the single treatment with SCFA, per se, was able to inhibit approximately 75% of colony formation, when compared with the negative control (Fig. 2 a). When combined with 5-FU, the inhibition of colony formation was observed, although higher than SCFA alone. This seems to be due mainly to the effects of the SCFA mixture, since the individual effects of 5-FU only presented values of around 20%.

In RKO cells, it was possible to unveil that the combined treatment with SCFA and 5-FU is able to induce cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, with a consequently decrease in the phases S and G2/M, when compared both with the negative control and the individual treatments (Fig. 3a).

Furthermore, a significant increase in the G2/M fraction was observed when compared with SCFA treatment alone, suggesting that the combination may also interfere with later stages of the cell cycle.

However, the low survival rate, specifically for patients with a late diagnosis, lead to an urgent need for the development of new strategies to enhance the efficacy of 5-FU (McQuade et al.; Okechukwu et al.).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34093</offset><text>5-FU is a synthetic fluorinated pyrimidine analogue administered intravenously that requires intracellular conversion into active metabolites (Blondy et al.). These active metabolites disrupt both DNA and RNA synthesis by inhibiting the action of thymidylate synthase, a critical enzyme involved in the synthesis of thymine nucleotide (Longley et al.; Pardini et al.). SCFA, namely acetate, butyrate, and propionate, emerged as microbiota-derived metabolites with high therapeutic potential, that specifically target CRC cells, while having low bystander effects in normal cells (Gomes et al.). Our group has already described that all three SCFA, individually or combined at the physiological proportions found in the human colon, are involved in the regulation of several biological processes in CRC cells, namely cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, energetic metabolism, cytosolic pH and lysosome membrane permeabilization (LMP) (Gomes et al.). Given the described potential associated with the effect of SCFA on CRC cells survival, the present work was performed in order to unveil if SCFA mixture is able to increase the efficacy of 5-FU-based chemotherapy. Considering that a high percentage of patients are diagnosed with CRC containing a KRAS or a BRAF mutation (approximately 40 and 10%, respectively), all the experiments were performed in two cell lines with different genetic backgrounds, i.e., HCT-15 cell line (with a KRAS G12D mutation) and RKO cell line (with a BRAF V600E mutation) (Preto et al.). At this stage, only tumorigenic cell lines were tested, since it has been already reported by our group that SCFA effects are specific towards CRC cells, as doses required for inhibiting 50% of cell growth of the cancer cell lines are lower than the doses required for NCM460 cells, a cell line with a non-tumorigenic epithelial background (Gomes et al.).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35970</offset><text>While total SCFA concentrations vary considerably along the intestinal tract and between individuals, the relative proportions among these three major SCFA remain relatively stable, and this was the rationale behind the selection of the acetate:butyrate:propionate rations to be tested (Gomes et al.). The regression model used to determine the 5-FU cytotoxic effects, alone or combined with different concentrations of SCFA, demonstrated that increasing concentrations of SCFA mixture are able to modulate the effects of 5-FU. The most promising results were obtained with the combination of the lower concentrations of both 5-FU and SCFA, indicating that there is not only a possibility to increase the efficacy of the treatment using low doses of SCFA but also that it is possible to decrease the 5-FU concentration to achieve the same anti-growth effects, suggesting the potential use of SCFA as co-adjuvants. There are already several studies reporting the synergistic effect of the combination treatment of chemotherapy and drugs in cancers. For example, combining 5-FU with kaempferol significantly suppressed colorectal cancer cell proliferation via downregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Li et al. Jul), and co-treatment with 5-FU and salinomycin potentiated ferroptotic cell death in colorectal cancer by inhibiting SLC7A11/GPX4 (Wang et al.).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37325</offset><text>5-FU treatment is associated with many side effects, including fatigue, loss of appetite, intestinal inflammation and diarrhea, the possibility of using lower doses can increase the efficacy of 5-FU while being beneficial to the quality of life of patients undergoing this line of treatment (Negarandeh et al.).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37637</offset><text>In order to understand if this impact could be extended to a long chemotherapy regimen, the effects of the combination of SCFA with 5-FU on cell survival and proliferation were assessed through colony formation assay (Teixeira-Guedes et al.). The results indicate that even after over a week after the exposure to a low dose of SCFA mixture, there was an inhibition on the formation of colonies, suggesting a promising effect in a prolonged treatment regimen, specifically in RKO cells harbouring a BRAF mutation. This difference observed after the treatment with SCFA in both cell lines could be explained based on the resistance associated with tumour cells with KRAS activating mutations, since it is already reported that a KRAS mutation status is often associated with a lack of benefit from regimens of chemotherapy, when compared with BRAF-mutated tumours (Garcia-Carbonero et al.).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38527</offset><text>The inhibition of cell cycle progression in cancer cells is an important strategy in controlling cancer progression, since cancer cells are often effective in overcoming checkpoint mechanisms and, therefore, undergo a continuous proliferation cycle (Hanahan; Hanahan and Weinberg; Hanahan et al.). Regarding the effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle analysis revealed that the combined treatment with low doses of both SCFA mixture and 5-FU blocked the cell cycle in both RKO and HCT-15 (Gomes et al.; Focaccetti et al.). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study revealing that proliferation inhibition through cell cycle arrest is affected when 5-FU and SCFA are combined at lower concentrations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>39242</offset><text>The wound healing assay was performed as a predictive method to study the inhibitory potential of the combined treatment on cell motility and migration, which is a relevant feature of cancer cell metastatic ability (Hanahan; Hanahan and Weinberg; Hanahan et al.). The results indicated that all treatments were able to inhibit RKO cells’ motility after 12 h of exposure, revealing a potential effect in blocking the migration, and the consequent metastasis of the tumours (Jonkman et al.). Regarding the invasiveness capacity of the RKO cells, proteomic characteristics of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a characteristic of invasive and metastatic cancers characterized by loss of intercellular contacts, loss of basoapical polarity, gain of mesenchymal markers and increased invasive properties have previously been reported (Halvey et al.). In the same study, the RKO motility/invasiveness phenotypes were evaluated and compared with another CRC-derived cell line by wound-healing and invasion assays, and the results revealed that RKO cells (BRAFV600Emutation) completely covered a scratched surface within 24 h, whereas open areas remained with SW480 cells (KRAS G12V mutation +) (Halvey et al.). Previous studies have demonstrated that butyrate is able to suppress the motility of CRC cells via deactivating AKT/ERK signalling in histone deacetylase dependent manner (Li et al.) and that that propionate has the potential to reduce viability and inhibit migration of glioblastoma cells (Filippone et al.). It was also reported that no changes were detected in the levels of different invasiveness-related proteins, namely SNAIL, E-cadherin, and vimentin, after the exposure of COLO-205 cells to acetate (Rodríguez-Enríquez et al.). However, the same cells exposed to butyrate or propionate revealed increased levels of several invasiveness proteins (Rodríguez-Enríquez et al.). Regarding the potential interference of 5-FU with CRC cell motility, it is already known that this compound inhibits the migration and invasion of CRC cells, possibly through the PI3K/Akt pathway regulated by the MARCH1 protein (Wang et al.). Considering this knowledge and the results previously published by our research group showing that butyrate seems to have the ability to “command” the SCFA mixture behaviour, we can hypothesize that the inhibition of CRC cells motility induced by the treatment with SCFA can be explained by the butyrate potential to block Akt/ERK signalling pathway.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41746</offset><text>The three-dimensional (3D) culture systems appeared as a complementary model to overcome some of the limitations associated with the traditional two-dimensional (2D) in vitro cell culture systems, such as the lack of cellular communication (cell–cell), interaction (cell–cell and cell–matrix) and architecture that is not representative of 3D tissues (Habanjar et al.). Furthermore, in order to decrease the use of animal-derived resources we took advantage of a new biocompatible scaffold produced and optimised by our group (Osório et al.). As described previously (Osório et al.), even though animal-derived scaffolds are vastly used in 3D culture for their ability of replicating in vivo microenvironment, they are associated with a plethora of disadvantages that affect reproducibility such as unclear composition and batch-to-batch variability. Hence, given its proven low cost, stability and biocompatibility, a synthetic electrospun polyurethane (PU) scaffold was selected for this study PU is vastly known for its hydrophilicity and degradation rate which allow the scaffold to interact with cell behaviour and their microenvironment (Gao et al.; Kaur et al.). As shown on the fluorescence microscopy images, we were able to successfully cultivate both RKO and HCT-15 spheroids in the scaffolds with no significant alterations in terms of cell morphology. The results obtained in the 3D cell culture were able to validate the 2D cell lines results, since the SRB assay showed that the combination of low doses of SCFA and 5-FU is effective in reducing the growth of the spheroids in both cells. Interestingly, a significant decrease of cell growth was also observed in RKO spheroids treated only with the SCFA mixture, indicating that when organized in 3D, cells can be more sensitive to the effects of SCFA. In fact, this pattern was already reported in a different study, in which the exposure to the same concentrations of cetuximab in both 2D and 3D produced higher effects in the spheroids, however, the reason beyond this increased sensitivity is still unknown (Melissaridou et al.).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43854</offset><text>In order to validate the use of a SCFA mixture to improve the effects of 5-FU in vivo, we used the well-established CAM in vivo model (Harper et al.). CAM provides tissue responses similar to those of cell-based and animal-based assays, with the advantage that CAM is not innervated and thus no pain can be experienced by the organism (Harper et al.). The usage of this animal model as pre-clinical model to study the effects of SCFA has been previously reported, where sodium butyrate-loaded nanoparticles were tested for the treatment of neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration (Reis et al.). To study possible effects in CRC, RKO cells were selected for this experiment as they present the most promising results in in vitro assays. We were able to show that the SCFA mixture, alone or combined with 5-FU, significantly decreased the size of the RKO tumours formed in the CAM. Although the combination did not outperform SCFA alone in the CAM model, it significantly reduced tumour size compared with 5-FU alone, indicating that SCFAs may increase the effects of low-dose 5-FU even in vivo. This finding, while not demonstrating synergy over SCFAs, suggests potential clinical relevance, as enhancing 5-FU efficacy could enable dose reduction and thereby mitigate treatment-associated adverse effects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45174</offset><text>This is a proof-of-concept that SCFA produced by the intestinal microbiota are important in the response to chemotherapy, at least to 5-FU. The concept of pharmacomicrobiomics has been investigated as a new discipline exploring the reciprocal interplay between the microbiota and drugs in the patient (Panebianco et al.; Chen et al.). In order to improve the therapeutic outcome and alleviate drug adverse effects, a number of approaches to selectively manipulate microbiota have been suggested, including administration of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics, and antibiotics in support of conventional treatments (Panebianco et al.). Accumulating evidences have also revealed that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has demonstrated remarkable clinical efficacy against several gastrointestinal diseases, namely Clostridium difficile infection, intractable functional constipation, inflammatory bowel diseases, and hematologic malignancies. Even though data regarding FMT in CRC patients are still limited, studies have demonstrated that the benefits of this approach include modulation of immunotherapy efficacy, amelioration of bile acid metabolism, and restoration of intestinal microbial diversity (Kaźmierczak-Siedlecka et al.).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46427</offset><text>Regarding the efficacy of anticancer drugs, there are already reports showing that live wild-type bacteria can affect the efficacy of some anticancer agents either positively or negatively in vitro and in vivo, most likely via enzymatic modifications (Lehouritis et al.). The cytotoxicity of several drugs, namely fludarabine and 6-mercaptopurine-2-deoxyadenosine, revealed to be increased when the bacterial concentration is higher, supporting the potential to improve therapeutic index through deliberate modification of the bacterial content of cancer patients or tumours (Lehouritis et al.).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>47023</offset><text>The overall composition of the microbiota, as well as substrate availability, intestinal pH, and transit time, influences the total amounts of SCFA, making microbial activity a key determinant of the SCFA pool and its physiological effects along the colon (Gomes et al.). The modulation of the intestinal microbiota composition towards a SCFA-producing species enrichment can constitute a promising strategy to improve chemotherapy (Gomes et al.; Lehouritis et al.). Since our results demonstrated that this increase of the 5-FU anticancer effects can be induced with low levels of SCFA, we can hypothesize that this modulation of the intestinal microbiota to produce SCFA can be done in a gentle way and with few implications in terms of side effects for patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>47789</offset><text>Recently, our group has identified the mechanism by which SCFA are able to kill CRC cells and we concluded that the SCFA-induced apoptotic cell death is associated with the LMP and a consequent cytosolic acidification (Gomes et al.). Lysosomes are acidic organelles that participate in cellular digestion, and, in the context of cancer, they are involved in drug sequestration which lowers the cytotoxic potential of chemotherapeutics, reduces drug availability to sites of action, and contributes to cancer resistance (Halaby; Sah et al.). Moreover, it has been reported that the activity of multiple enzymes in lysosomes is significantly increased in many cancers when compared to normal tissues, increasing the predisposition for the acquisition of chemotherapeutic drugs resistance and thus constituting a relevant clinical problem (Tang et al.). Particularly in the case of 5-FU treatment, several studies have suggested that lysosome-induced autophagy is an important resistance mechanism in different types of cancer (Sun et al.; Xiao et al.; Lund et al.). In this regard, we hypothesise that the results herein presented showing the ability of a SCFA mixture to increase the effectiveness of the 5-FU treatment against CRC could be explained due to the induction of LMP that will decrease the resistance to 5-FU by blocking the autophagy process.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>49144</offset><text>Study limitations and directions for future work</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>49193</offset><text>This study represents a proof-of-concept for the potential of SCFA to enhance the efficacy of a highly used chemotherapeutic drug in CRC treatment. Along with the different indications of a synergistic effect of acetate, butyrate and propionate together with 5-FU against different CRC hallmarks, it is also important to highlight some limitations that should be taken into consideration for further studies. Although the SCFA and 5-FU combinatorial effects have been observed in several assays using different research models, this outcome was context-dependent which may require some additional mechanistic investigation. Mechanistic readouts, which may include HDAC activity, TYMS modulation, DNA-damage markers, and metabolic adaptations, can be considered in future studies. Additionally, the validation of the present findings in additional in vivo models, such as murine model, should be considered to better define the translational potential of SCFAs as co-adjuvants to 5-FU.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>50178</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">10565_2026_10147_Fig7_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig7</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>50190</offset><text>Overview of the effects of a combination of SCFA with 5-FU in CRC, using different research models</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>50289</offset><text>Taken together, the results herein presented suggested for the first time that microbiota-derived SCFA mixture have the potential to increase the efficacy of 5-FU, in a context-dependent manner. Importantly, this improvement is induced with low doses of both SCFA and of 5-FU, which are not harmful to normal cells, indicating that it would probably be associated with low side effects and with less resistance to 5-FU. Since our results were confirmed in different research models with different levels of complexity, we believe that there is a potential for clinical application of the combined treatment of SCFA with at least 5-FU in CRC patients (Fig. 7). We believe in the importance of promoting the increase of SCFA levels in CRC patients through the modulation of the intestinal microbiota composition towards more favourable bacteria species for SCFA production, namely using dietary supplements such as pre- or probiotics or fecal transplantation. In this way, it would be possible to improve the efficacy of the treatment of CRC patients, decreasing the concentration of the chemotherapeutic agent by the promotion of a healthier microbiota composition, with clear repercussions in terms of the success of the treatment and the quality of life of the patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>51562</offset><text>Collectively, our results support the potential of SCFA as safe, microbiota-derived adjuvants to conventional chemotherapy, paving the way for microbiome-informed strategies to improve CRC treatment efficacy and reduce drug toxicity. </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>51797</offset><text>Supplementary Information</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>51823</offset><text>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>51883</offset><text>Highlights</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>51894</offset><text>• The microbiota-derived SCFA increase the efficacy of 5-FU chemotherapy in CRC.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>51977</offset><text>• SCFA impacts the effects of low doses of 5-FU in complementary research models.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>52061</offset><text>• Microbiota modulation can promote SCFA production thus beneficiating CRC treatment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>52149</offset><text>Publisher's Note</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>52166</offset><text>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>52285</offset><text>Author contributions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>52306</offset><text>All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
