The most prominent manifestations of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). UC is characterized by a continuous pattern that commonly starts with lesions in rectum mucosa and is contained in the colon. On the other hand, CD affects the ileum and colon in a discontinuous pattern, and the lesions are often transmural. Conventional therapies often face limitations such as systemic side effects, poor drug stability, and low site-specificity. In recent years, nanoparticle (NP) systems have emerged as a promising strategy to overcome these challenges, offering improved targeting, controlled release, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Several studies have shown that the preferential accumulation of NPs in the inflamed colon is influenced by the pathophysiological changes associated with IBD, including alterations in transit time, pH value, enzymatic activity, microbial composition, and mucus integrity. These disease-specific characteristics provide unique opportunities to design smart and responsive NPs that enhance drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic exposure. This work presents an overview of novel technologies based on nanosystems, with the ability to specifically target the affected areas of the GI tract in inflammatory bowel disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1646</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1662</offset><text>Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic relapsing inflammations of the gut. In recent decades, the prevalence of IBD has been substantially increased throughout the world, affecting not only people in high-income countries but also in newly industrialized countries. From 1990 to 2017, the prevalence of IBD increased 85% worldwide, evolving into a global disease. Owing to the young age of onset, low mortality, and lack of cure, it is estimated that the number of people with IBD will rise exponentially, representing a substantial burden on public healthcare. The direct costs of managing the 2.5–3.0 million people suffering from IBD in Europe are estimated to be around EUR 5–6 billion annually. More importantly, more than 20% of patients suffering from IBD will develop colorectal cancer within 30 years of disease onset.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2575</offset><text>The pathogenesis of IBD is poorly understood, but genetic and environmental factors seem to contribute to the loss of intestinal immune homeostasis, leading to chronic inflammation. Currently, there is no cure for IBD, and the treatment relies mainly on anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents with local or systemic action. Conventional treatment of acute episodes of disease consists of the daily administration of high doses of 5-amynosalicylates (5-ASAs) or corticosteroids drugs. However, conventional dosage forms fail to provide enhanced and sustained drug levels at the site of inflammation, leading to inconsistent efficacy, frequent dosing schedules, and severe side effects. In recent years, biologics (especially anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents) have revolutionized the treatment of moderate-to-severe IBD not responsive to conventional therapy or with extensive small bowel involvement in CD. However, the need for parenteral administration and serious side effects compromises their efficacy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3603</offset><text>Drug-targeting technologies are urgently needed to deliver drugs directly to the affected area of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or even cells of interest for improved efficiency and desired biodistribution profiles. Suitable engineering of nanosystems allows the selective delivery of drugs to the sites and/or cells of interest, either by receptor–ligand, physical, or chemical targeting. This manuscript provides an up-to-date and concise overview of the development of targeted nanotechnology-based systems for inflammatory bowel diseases treatment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4160</offset><text>2. Etiology and Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4236</offset><text>The precise mechanism behind the onset of IBD is not fully understood. Rather than being caused by a single factor, IBD seems to result from a complex interplay between genetic, microbial, epithelium-mediated, immunological, and environmental factors (Figure 1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4499</offset><text>Familial aggregation and twin studies have established a genetic contribution to the development of IBD, but the heritable component seems to be stronger in CD than in UC. Specific gene variations that increase susceptibility to IBD have been identified. The first gene to be associated with IBD was NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2), encoding a protein that recognizes molecular patterns present in bacteria and activates signaling pathways that modulate immune responses. Mutations in the NOD2 gene result in unresponsiveness to pathogens, allowing them to penetrate the gut and trigger an immune inflammatory response. Other genes associated with the immune response, detection of pathogens, autophagy (ATG16L1, IRGM), phagocytosis, or intestinal barrier integrity (MUC19) have been identified as having a role in the development of IBD. Disruption in the function of many of these genes increases the risk of development of IBD, but also of other inflammatory disorders. Although genetic factors are important, no single genetic variant can explain the development of IBD on its own. The fact that most individuals who carry IBD-associated risk variants remain healthy, while others develop IBD, emphasizes this inference. Clearly, genetics alone is unable to explain the susceptibility and progression of IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5850</offset><text>Nonetheless, several environmental factors have been linked to an increased risk of IBD in genetically susceptible individuals. These include smoking, diet, and the use of certain medications. The effects of smoking have been extensively studied and described as a risk factor for CD. In contrast, smoke seems to exert a protective role in UC. Exposure to diets rich in saturated fatty acids and processed foods has been reported to increase the risk of IBD. Conversely, a high-fiber diet has been found to reduce the risk of CD. The use of certain medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and contraceptives, is also associated with an increased risk IBD. Direct toxicity to immune- and mucus-producing cells, autophagy impairment, and induction of microbiome dysbiosis are some of the mechanisms by which environmental factors contribute to IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6730</offset><text>Microbiome dysbiosis is one of the most important mechanisms triggered by environmental factors. Dysbiosis is defined as an imbalance of gut microbiota, with consequences in its composition and function. This imbalance is characterized by (a) a decrease in beneficial microbiota species, (b) an increase in pathogenic microorganisms, (c) lack of diversity in microbiota species, or, more frequently, (d) the combination of all these features. Microorganisms of a healthy microbiota have a crucial role in the normal immune response, modulating it and maintaining its homeostasis along with the intestinal epithelial barrier. Microbiota dysbiosis has been observed in IBD patients. IBD patients present a decrease in bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, propionic acid, and acetate, which have anti-inflammatory effects. Conversely, it can be observed that there is an increase in bacteria with pro-inflammatory properties. Regardless of whether it is a cause or consequence of the disease, microbiota appears to play a major role in the development and progression of the disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7847</offset><text>Gut microbiota in patients with IBD have less biodiversity when compared to normal patients. These cases have an increased quantity of Escherichia coli, which is a pathogenic bacteria, and an increase in mucolytic bacteria, like Ruminococcus gnavus. There are also some bacteria that can decrease, such as Firmicutes and Clostridium, which play a big role in the diversity and regulation of the microbiota.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">pharmaceutics-18-00055-g001.jpg</infon><infon key="id">pharmaceutics-18-00055-f001</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>8254</offset><text>Factors contributing to inflammatory bowel disease.

This structure plays important role in mediating the crosstalk between the intestinal microbiota and the host immune system, largely through bidirectional signaling between microbial communities and IECs. In IBD, this communication is disrupted by increased epithelial permeability, which represents a key mechanism contributing to disease pathogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8870</offset><text>The inflammatory response in IBD is different when comparing ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. In UC, CD4+ lymphocytes possess a phenotype for a type 2 helper T-cell (Th2) that is responsible for the production of transforming growth factor β (TGF- β) and interleukin-5. Alternately, CD is characterized by CD4+ lymphocytes with the phenotype for a type 1 helper T-cell (Th1) that is responsible for the production interferon-γ and interleukin-2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9333</offset><text>Cytokine pathways in IBD can be divided by innate immunity and adaptative immunity. Innate immunity is characterized by the release of TNF-related cytokines, Il-6, and Il-1. TNF is a cytokine that is capable of inducing apoptosis in tumor cells and exerting a wide range of pro-inflammatory actions. These responses are mediated by the TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors. This process results in immune system dysregulation driven by T-cells, characterized by enhanced effector T-cell activity and the subsequent recruitment of additional immune cells that amplify the inflammatory response. Within the TNF superfamily, another important member is TL1-A (TNF ligand-related molecule 1A), which binds to the death receptor 3 (DR3), a receptor capable of activating Map kinases. In IBD, both TL1-A and DR3 are upregulated, and due to the widespread expression of TL1-A across multiple cell types, it is challenging to attribute its specific endothelial expression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10287</offset><text>IL-6 increases intestinal permeability by targeting the tight junction protein Claudin-2, which facilitates the passage of small cations across the epithelial layer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10453</offset><text>On the other hand, adaptive immunity is characterized by the involvement of IL-12, IL-23, and Th17 cells. IL-12 and IL-23 share the p40 subunit, with IL-23 also containing the p19 subunit. IL-12 primarily acts on naïve T-cells, while IL-23 plays a role in memory T-cells. Th17 cells have an active participation in the development of inflammation in IBD. CD4+ lymphocytes can differentiate in Th17 cells by stimulation of IL-6 and TGF-β, and subsequently, Th-17 cells secrete IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and TNF-α. IL-17 and IL-21 in patients with IBD can stimulate the secretion of proteases that in return will cause epithelial cell damage. IL-21 can also promote more differentiation of Th17-cells and more secretion of IL-17. Il-23 is also associated with the stimulation, and proliferation of Th-17 cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>11264</offset><text>3.

Typically, the stomach has an acidic environment (pH 1 to 3). In the small intestine, the environment becomes less acidic and more neutral (pH 6.5 to 7). The proximal colon is acidic again (pH 5 to 7), and finally pH rises in the rectum (pH 7–8). In IBD, pH levels can change. In the small intestine, pH remains relatively unchanged; however, in the colon, a decrease in pH (pH values around 2.3–5.5) has been observed compared to a healthy individual.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11904</offset><text>3.2. Mucus</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11915</offset><text>Mucus is a layer that surrounds the intestinal epithelium and serves to protect the epithelium from damage, preventing the binding of pathogens to the epithelial surface, and provide lubrication (Figure 2). These functions are made possible by goblet cells, which are responsible for secreting mucus. The colonic mucus comprises two distinct layers: a basal layer, which is more dense and adherent to the epithelial surface and resistant to bacteria, and an outer, looser layer located in the luminal space. The inner, firmly attached mucus layer is continuously renewed and feeds the non-adherent outer mucus layer, which harbors a vast community of intestinal commensal bacteria. In IBD, due to the loss of epithelial integrity and tissue ischemia, protective pathways are activated as a compensatory response. However, this activation can paradoxically lead to a reduction in mucus production. Typically, UC is characterized by a decrease in goblet cells number, a reduction in MUC 2 expression, and a thinning mucus layer. In contrast, goblets cells hypertrophy is seen in CD with an increased mucus production, which can be up to three times more compared to healthy individuals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13100</offset><text>3.3.

These changes are primarily characterized by increased activity of certain enzymes, including proteases and lipases. Enzymes derived from intestinal microbiota also undergo significant modulation and may represent critical targets for therapeutic intervention in IBD. Enhanced proteolytic activity contributes to disease progression and is positively correlated with IBD severity and activity. Elevated levels of tryptase, for instance, can activate pro-inflammatory cytokines, and promote intestinal fibrosis, thereby exacerbating disease activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13806</offset><text>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that cleave components of extracellular cellular matrix, promoting cellular turnover.

Intestinal Epithelium</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14164</offset><text>The intestinal epithelium acts as the physical barrier against harm. This layer is composed of specialized IECs, such as goblet cells, Paneth cells, and many others. So, in a healthy individual, this maintains balance between microbiota and immune cells. In patients with IBD, the inflammatory response often results in continuous epithelial injury, leading to ulcers and erosions that compromise the intestinal barrier. Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of IBD, though the exact relationship between the barrier defects and chronic inflammation is complex, with defects potentially acting as both a cause and a consequence. At the same time, defects in IECs can play a significant role in the development and progression of IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14905</offset><text>Beyond their absorptive function, enterocytes are actively involved in shaping the intestinal immune environment by secreting cytokines and interacting with immune cells. Goblet cells are mucus-secreting cells, assuring the presence of a continuous mucus layer that protects the intestine against harmful substances or microorganisms. Furthermore, goblet cells play an important role in immune regulation. Paneth cells contribute to epithelial repair and regulation of inflammation, by secreting chemokines, cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides, such as α-defensins. Reduced secretion of α-defensins by Paneth cells was found in patients with ileal CD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15567</offset><text>Barrier dysfunction is driven by altered epithelial permeability, particularly its increase under inflammatory conditions. Epithelial permeability is regulated both at cellular level and through tight junctions (TJs). An intact intestinal epithelium depends on tight junctions, which help seal the space between adjacent epithelial cells (the paracellular space). TJs are composed of claudins, proteins that form cation-selective channels. These channels can respond to immune-mediated signals, resulting in increased permeability. Such alterations facilitate translocation of luminal antigens, thereby perpetuating disease progression. Increased intestinal permeability has been reported in IBD patients. The impairment of intestinal permeability is assigned to different molecular mechanisms, including altered expression and structural changes in tight junctions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>16434</offset><text>3.5. Intestinal Transit Time/Mobility</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16472</offset><text>In healthy individuals, the median gastric transit time is approximately 22 min, although this value can be influenced by factors such as diet, fasted or fed state, and usual physical activities. In UC, an increase in transit time is often observed. Regarding intestinal contractions, despite the prolonged transit time, bowel movement frequency may also be increased. This apparent paradox can be explained by the fact that not all contractions are propulsive; therefore, the higher number of contractions does not necessarily result in faster transit. An explanation for the increased transit time, despite more frequent bowel movements, is that the latter may reflect episodes of frequent and urgent defecation rather than efficient propulsion. Rectal distension can trigger reflex pathways that slow transit in the proximal segments of the gastrointestinal tract, thereby contributing to the overall delay.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>17383</offset><text>3.6.

Electrolyte imbalance and altered intestinal volume are attributed to dysregulation of sodium transport. Sodium hydrogen exchangers (NHEs) mediate the exchange of Na+ for H+. In IBD, NHE3 activity is significantly reduced, rendering patients more susceptible to diarrhea. The sodium potassium ATPase also contributes to the development of disturbances in intestinal volume and further exacerbates sodium malabsorption.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18002</offset><text>In addition to sodium, chloride transport is also impaired.

Limitations of Current Dosage Forms for the Delivery of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Drugs</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19195</offset><text>Conventional treatment of IBD typically involves aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics, along with additional measures or surgical intervention. The specific approach is based on disease severity and extent, location, and previous treatment history. Treatment goals are focused on controlling inflammation, avoiding complications, and limiting disease progression. Two steps can be followed: the “step-up” and the “top-down”. In the first case, disease flares will first be treated with aminosalicylates or corticosteroids. In case of failure, or to achieve steroid-free remission, immunomodulators, biologicals, and small-molecule inhibitors will be considered. In the “top-down” approach, the treatment starts with immunomodulators, biologics, or a combination of both. The “step-up” approach is recommended in the recent guidelines of the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization (ECCO), with evidence suggesting top-down may be more effective for achieving and maintaining remission, especially in certain cases with poor prognostic outcome, by preventing long-term complication.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20327</offset><text>Therapeutic agents can be delivered through oral, parenteral, or rectal routes, each with distinct advantages and limitations (Table 1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20464</offset><text>Oral administration remains the most common, due to its convenience for self-administration, favorable safety profiles, and flexibility in dose adjustment.

Lamprecht et al. initially demonstrated that 100 nm polystyrene particles adhere more effectively to TNBS-induced inflamed colonic tissue compared to larger counterparts (1 µm, 10 µm). Complementing these findings, a redox- and pH-responsive lipid-like nanoparticle system showed size-dependent accumulation in DSS-induced colitis; mid-sized NPs (~113 nm) accumulated most efficiently in inflamed regions.

Compared to their cationic or neutral counterparts, anionic liposomes demonstrated higher adhesion to inflamed tissues. Furthermore, anionic liposomes enhanced the activity of antioxidant molecules (catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and SOD-mimic tempamine) following intracolonic administration to rats with DNBS-induced colitis. The infiltration of immune cells into the mucosa leads to increased concentration of positively charged proteins (e.g., eosinophil cationic proteins, transferrin, and antimicrobial peptides) in inflamed sites, which, combined with a reduction in negative charges due to mucus deterioration (in the case of UC), explains the preferential target of anionic systems to injured tissues.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35798</offset><text>While cationic NPs increase the adherence within the mucus layer and anionic NPs increase the interaction with the injured epithelial barrier, neutral NPs have proved to be important to circumvent the mucus barrier due to the lack of interactions with mucins. NPs with a near-neutral surface charge, often achieved through hydrophilic coatings like PEG, are crucial for crossing the intestinal mucus barrier once they minimize strong electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged mucin glycoproteins, allowing them to diffuse through the mucus mesh instead of getting trapped or quickly cleared. Several studies have demonstrated that a dense PEGylation of small NPs’ (50–200 nm) surfaces with a low-molecular-weight PEG (2–5 KDa) allows a rapid transposition of the intestinal mucus barrier. Although initial studies were conducted on healthy tissues, mucus-penetrating NPs have also exhibited this property in inflamed intestinal tissues. Using PEGylated mucus-penetrating NPs to deliver drugs such as budesonide, teduglutide, cyclosporine A, and anti-TNF-α antibodies has been shown to enhance the resolution of colitis in vivo more effectively than standard treatments or free drugs. While a molecular weight of 5 kDa was generally recognized as optimal for achieving mucus-penetrating properties in PEGylated NPs, recent studies have shown that those with a molecular weight of 2 kDa (PLGA-PEG2k) were more efficient in alleviating inflammation in an acute murine colitis model than those with a molecular weight of 5 kDa (PLGA-PEG5k). Although PLGA-PEG2k and PLGA-PEG5k exhibited similar behavior regarding their interaction with mucins in vitro, the higher hydrophilicity of PLGA-PEG5k NPs decreased its interaction with inflamed intestinal tissue in mice. This resulted in lower efficacy of PLGA-PEG5k NPs in reducing inflammation when delivering an anti-TNF-α antibody, as indicated by a worse colon weight/length ratio, a lower histological score, and increased tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), compared to anti-TNF-α antibody-loaded PLGA-PEG2k NPs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37896</offset><text>Cationic and anionic NPs can interact non-specifically with non-target tissues and cells, leading to unwanted adhesion that reduces therapeutic efficacy and increases the risk of toxicity.

These findings position the TL1A–DR3 pathway as one of the most promising ligand–receptor systems for therapeutic intervention in IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>47762</offset><text>Recent reviews further emphasize the potential of less conventional receptors such as PepT1, CD98, and dectin-1, whose upregulation during intestinal inflammation offers additional opportunities for oral, ligand-directed therapies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">pharmaceutics-18-00055-t003.xml</infon><infon key="id">pharmaceutics-18-00055-t003</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>47994</offset><text>Overview of receptor-targeted nanoparticles for inflammatory bowel disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">pharmaceutics-18-00055-t003.xml</infon><infon key="id">pharmaceutics-18-00055-t003</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

For example, mannosylated inulin-based NPs demonstrated selective uptake by activated macrophages through the mannose receptor, a surface molecule that is overexpressed on pro-inflammatory macrophages during intestinal inflammation. This receptor-mediated recognition significantly enhanced the internalization of the NPs compared to non-mannosylated controls, ensuring that the therapeutic payload was preferentially delivered to the immune cells most responsible for driving mucosal injury. Moreover, by sparing non-target cells, this approach minimized potential off-target effects and systemic toxicity, highlighting the therapeutic advantage of macrophage-selective nanocarriers for IBD therapy. Building on this concept, Mow et al. introduced a novel lipid nanoparticle formulation designed for oral administration that was capable of targeting both colonic epithelial cells and macrophages. In healthy tissue, epithelial uptake predominated, supporting mucosal delivery and barrier restoration, while in inflammatory conditions macrophage uptake was significantly increased, thereby addressing immune-driven inflammation. This dual-targeting strategy effectively exploited disease-dependent micro-environmental changes, achieving localized drug accumulation, attenuating colonic damage, and maintaining an excellent safety profile.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>51627</offset><text>Beyond macrophages, epithelial cells of the colon also represent an attractive target for drug delivery. A recent study developed a PepT1-targeted nanodrug based on the co-assembly of an anti-inflammatory peptide and an immunosuppressant, which selectively interacted with the PepT1 transporter on epithelial cells. This system effectively restored barrier integrity by enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins such as Claudin-5, Occludin-1, and ZO-1, while simultaneously attenuating colitis symptoms in murine models. Similarly, microRNA-200-loaded lipid NPs have been shown to promote epithelial regeneration by restoring intestinal stem cell function in damaged mucosa, highlighting their potential in therapies aiming to rebuild the epithelial compartment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>52400</offset><text>Recent studies have provided insights into how modulating goblet cell activity can ameliorate disease. For example, autophagy activation (Beclin-1-mediated) in mice reduces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in goblet cells, resulting in thicker, more protective mucus layers and attenuated inflammation. Specifically, constitutive activation of autophagy via Beclin-1 alleviates ER stress in goblet cells, leading to enhanced mucus secretion and a more robust intestinal barrier. This process is microbiota-dependent and requires the activity of the intracellular sensor NOD2. Furthermore, overproduction of mucus alters the gut microbiome, expanding mucus-utilizing bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila, and protects against chemical- and infection-driven intestinal inflammation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>53186</offset><text>Targeting strategies that exploit endothelial activation have shown promise.

Toxicity and Safety Concerns of IBD-Selective-Nanoparticulate Systems</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>53627</offset><text>Despite the significant progress achieved in the nanomedicine field in recent years, toxicity and safety concerns remain hurdles to its clinical translation. Little is known about the toxicity of NPs on the GIT tract. The potential toxic effects of orally administered NPs may be exerted directly on intestinal mucosa or on other tissues and organs of the body following systemic absorption. The local toxicity of NPs can affect the mucus barrier, gut microbiota, epithelial cells, tight junctions, and immune cells. Conversely, physiological or pathological factors can induce changes in NPs, rendering toxicity or loss of biological activity. This is particularly important when evaluating the toxicity and safety of nanosystems targeting inflamed intestinal tissues, since the disease is already present and potential toxicity could worsen the inflammation. Furthermore, the modifications made to obtain targeted NPs including size, surface charge, and surface modifications (e.g., PEGylation), as well as the materials used to obtain targeted features (e.g., pH- or ROS-responsive polymers), potentially lead to changes in their pharmacokinetic and toxicological profile. In vitro cell culture models are commonly used to assess the toxicity of IBD-targeted NPs against intestinal (e.g., Caco-2) and immune cells (e.g., THP-1). More complex 3D intestinal inflamed models better mimicking an in vivo-like intestinal inflammation environment may be useful used to assess molecular mechanisms of NP toxicity. Limited in vivo biodistribution and safety studies in preclinical animal models, particularly in murine models, give some insights regarding the distribution of targeted IBD NPs in the body and their safety profile. The loading of Cyclosporine A (CsA) into mucus-penetrating PEGylated PLGA NPs (CsA-MNP) led to a reduction of one quarter of its systemic exposure after a single oral administration to rats at a toxic dose of CsA ((Neoral®, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation), 10 mg-CsA/kg). After daily administration of the same dose of CsA-MNP for 9 days, no significant changes were observed in plasma biomarkers, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine levels, while these biomarkers were increased in the Neoral®-treated group. However, one limitation of the study was the use of healthy animals to assess the potential systemic exposure and kidney damage of CsA-MNP. The presence of disease may influence the pharmacokinetic profile of CsA-MNP. Qassem et al. evaluated the safety profile of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) composed of newly synthesized ionizable lipids (Lipid 15, ~70 nm, near-neutral surface charge) following retro-orbital injection into a DSS-induced colitis mouse model. Twenty hours later, the levels of the hepatic enzymes alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in the animals treated with LNA-loaded LNPs and unloaded LNPs remained unchanged and were similar to those of healthy animals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>56612</offset><text>Translating animal data into human treatments entails significant complexity, and this aspect is even more striking when animal models of disease are used, as in the case of IBD models. The pathophysiological differences between IBD murine models and human IBD, as well as the cross-species differences in biocompatibility and safety, may result in different NP safety profiles when translated into humans. In addition, NPs for IBD treatment warrant long-term safety evaluations. This is particularly important due to the chronic nature of the disease and the need for long-term administration.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>57207</offset><text>7. Conclusions and Future Perspectives</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>57246</offset><text>Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (NPs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the preclinical management IBD. Their unique physicochemical properties, including small size, tunable surface modifications, and capacity to encapsulate diverse therapeutic cargos, enable site-specific delivery, controlled release, and reduced systemic toxicity compared to conventional formulations. Recent studies have highlighted their ability to accumulate at inflamed intestinal sites by exploiting pathophysiological features such as pH shifts, enzymatic activity, and oxidative stress.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>57829</offset><text>Future research directions point toward multifunctional and precision-driven approaches. The development of multi-targeting NPs capable of acting simultaneously on immune and epithelial compartments could yield more comprehensive therapeutic effects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>58080</offset><text>Despite significant progress, no nanomedicine-based IBD drug delivery system has entered clinical trials to date. Several hurdles remain to be overcome before intestinal inflammation-targeted nanosystems can be translated into clinical practice. Some of the challenges to be addressed in the next chapters of nanomedicine’s clinical translation include regulatory constraints, scalability issues, protocol standardization, and the need for long-term safety data in humans.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>58555</offset><text>In conclusion, nanomedicine represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of IBD. By addressing the current limitations of conventional therapies, NPs hold the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy, minimize adverse events, and enable personalized interventions. Continued interdisciplinary collaboration among material scientists, gastroenterologists, immunologists, and regulatory authorities will be essential to bridge the gap between preclinical promise and clinical application. With sustained innovation and rigorous translational research, nanoparticle-based systems are expected to become a cornerstone in the future management of IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>59203</offset><text>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
