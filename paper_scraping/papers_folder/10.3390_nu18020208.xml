Immunomodulatory nutrients such as arginine, glutamine, and β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB) have shown potential benefits; however, their combined molecular effects on UC remain insufficiently defined. Objective: To investigate the individual and combined effects of arginine, glutamine, and HMB on inflammatory and metabolic gene expression, oxidative stress markers, and histopathological outcomes in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. Methods: Female Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to six groups: control, DSS, DSS + arginine, DSS + glutamine, DSS + HMB, and DSS + mixture. Colitis was induced using 3% DSS. Colon tissues were examined histologically, serum MDA, MPO, and GSH levels were quantified, and mRNA expression of IL6, IL10, COX2, NOS2, ARG2, CCR1, and ALDH4A1 was measured by RT-qPCR. Pathway enrichment analyses were performed to interpret cytokine and metabolic network regulation. Results: DSS induced severe mucosal injury, elevated MDA and MPO, reduced GSH, and significantly increased IL6, COX2, NOS2, ARG2, and CCR1 expression. Glutamine demonstrated the strongest anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by decreasing IL6 and COX2 and restoring GSH. Arginine primarily modulated nitric oxide–related pathways, whereas HMB increased ALDH4A1 expression and metabolic adaptation. The combination treatment produced more balanced modulation across inflammatory, chemokine, and metabolic pathways, consistent with enrichment results highlighting cytokine signaling and amino acid metabolism. Histopathological improvement was greatest in the mixture group. Conclusions: Arginine, glutamine, and HMB ameliorate DSS-induced colitis through coordinated regulation of cytokine networks, oxidative stress responses, and metabolic pathways. Their combined use yields broader and more harmonized therapeutic effects than individual administration, supporting their potential as targeted immunonutritional strategies for UC. Rather than targeting a single inflammatory mediator, this study was designed to test whether combined immunonutrient supplementation could promote coordinated regulation of cytokine signaling, oxidative stress responses, and metabolic adaptation, thereby facilitating mucosal repair in experimental colitis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2582</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2598</offset><text>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder of unknown etiology characterized by acute and chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, with periods of recurrent relapse and remission. IBD is increasing worldwide. The global age-standardized incidence rate of IBD is 4.45 per 100,000 and is more common in women. The burden of IBD is expected to increase as the world’s population grows and ages. Possible mechanisms and mediators that cause disease progression are still being investigated, and the underlying mechanism is thought to be dysregulation of inflammatory processes involving proinflammatory cytokines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3253</offset><text>Inflammatory bowel diseases are a group of diseases in which malabsorption of nutrients and malnutrition occur in 20–85% of patients. The disease is primarily treated with drugs, but the pharmacological agents used increase the risk of anemia and malignancy due to the development of opportunistic infections. Malnutrition leads to bacterial translocation and disruption of the gastrointestinal tract mucosal barrier integrity. To prevent protein loss due to ulceration and to alleviate symptoms, it is necessary to replace nutritional deficiencies. Dietary modulation can reduce disease-related symptoms in IBD, prevent relapses, and contribute to successful management of the disease. Currently, there is no accepted nutritional treatment for patients with IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4019</offset><text>Proteins are important in the management of IBD, its remission, the reduction in its complications and the improvement of the quality of life of individuals. Pharmacological agents can alter amino acid metabolism. It is noteworthy that the amino acid requirements of patients with IBD differ from those of healthy individuals. Glutamine and arginine have significant effects on the immune system and may be a potential treatment for IBD. Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid and a precursor of NO. It causes a decrease in the number of suppressor T cells, an increase in the number of helper T cells, and an increase in the lymphatic response to mitogens. Tissue arginine levels are reduced in IBD due to decreased uptake and increased NOS2. Glutamine is a precursor for the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and many biologically important molecules. Therefore, it is an essential amino acid for the continuity of gastrointestinal mucosa, lymphocytes and fibroblasts, which are constantly dividing and multiplying. It is necessary for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal structure, but its role in IBD is not clear. HMB is an active metabolite of the essential amino acid leucine. It is synthesized in small amounts in humans and has an effect on the immune system. HMB has anti-inflammatory effects in the gut and may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5418</offset><text>Arginine, glutamine, and β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB) were selected based on their complementary roles in intestinal immunity and metabolism. Glutamine supports epithelial integrity and antioxidant capacity; arginine regulates nitric oxide–dependent immune responses; and HMB, a leucine-derived metabolite, has been reported to influence inflammatory signaling and cellular metabolic responses and to support tissue repair processes, particularly under conditions of inflammatory or catabolic stress. Together, these nutrients represent a targeted immunonutritional approach aimed at restoring mucosal homeostasis through coordinated regulation of inflammatory and metabolic pathways.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6113</offset><text>The demonstration of the effect of the arginine + glutamine + HMB mixture used in enteral nutrition therapy on gastrointestinal tissue damage caused by IBD suggests that the mixture may have an alternative use in the treatment of IBD. To our knowledge, no study has been conducted to investigate the effects of this mixture on the molecular level against damage caused by experimental intestinal colitis. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms involved in the arginine + glutamine + HMB mixture in DSS-induced colitis. Elucidation of these mechanisms will provide a basis for development of new treatment strategies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6746</offset><text>2.

Following approval of the experimental protocol, 48 female Sprague Dawley rats, 8–12 weeks old (200–300 g), were obtained from SBU Laboratory Animal Center in Istanbul, Türkiye (Decision no: 2018-02/03, 3 April 2018). Only female Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study to reduce variability related to sex-dependent differences in DSS-induced colitis severity and inflammatory responses. This approach is consistent with previous DSS colitis models and reflects the higher prevalence of ulcerative colitis reported in female populations. Rats were divided into six groups: control (n = 8), colitis (n = 8), colitis with l-arginine supplementation (DSS + Arginine; n = 8), colitis with l-glutamine supplementation (DSS + Glutamine; n = 8), colitis with β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate butyrate supplementation (DSS + HMB; n = 8) and colitis with arginine, l-glutamine and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate mix supplementation (DSS + Combine; n = 8). A total of 48 rats were housed in cages with four rats per cage. The rats were kept in a standard laboratory environment with a 12 h light/dark cycle, 45–60% relative humidity, and room temperature of 22 ± 2 °C.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8073</offset><text>DSS was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.

For seven days, animals were fed a standard diet and drinking water ad libitum. Group 1 (control) received the standard diet without DSS. Group 2 (colitis) received the standard diet with DSS. Colitis was induced in the groups 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 by administering DSS (3% [w/v], molecular weight 40,000) in the drinking water for the 7 days. Following DSS induction, supplements were administered orally twice daily (morning and evening) from day 8 to day 14 using a sterile 4F flexible polyurethane feeding tube (outer diameter ≈ 1.3 mm), gently inserted via the oral cavity into the esophagus. Rats were briefly restrained manually without anesthesia, and correct placement was ensured prior to administration to prevent tracheal insertion. Each dose was freshly prepared in distilled water and delivered in a total volume not exceeding 1 mL per administration. After colitis was induced, the group 3 received 200 mg/kg l-arginine, the group 4 received 200 mg/kg l-glutamine, the group 5 received 40 mg/kg β-hydroxy-β-methyl methyl butyrate, and the group 6 received an Arg/Glu/HMB mixture containing 200 mg/kg arginine, 200 mg/kg glutamine, and 40 mg/kg β-hydroxy-β-methyl methyl butyrate orally twice a day via a 4F feeding tube between the 8th and 14th days. The dosage of supplements was determined based on the previous study. On day 15, rats were sacrificed under general anesthesia induced by intramuscular injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and then the colon and blood samples were taken. The colonic segment was used for histopathological observation. The proximal segment was used for PCR analysis.

Combined supplementation integrated these mechanisms, promoting coordinated immunometabolic regulation and mucosal repair. Histopathological examination confirmed typical DSS-induced alterations, including goblet cell loss, glandular disruption, inflammatory cell infiltration, and submucosal edema. Consistent with these findings, the colitis group showed severe mucosal loss and inflammatory granulation tissue, whereas treatment—especially the combination—markedly improved tissue architecture and produced results approaching those of the control group.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21961</offset><text>Oxidative stress markers responded differentially to treatment. DSS increased MDA and MPO levels and reduced GSH, in agreement with previous reports. Although MPO is primarily an intracellular enzyme stored in neutrophil granules, inflammatory activation and epithelial barrier disruption during DSS-induced colitis promote its extracellular release and systemic translocation. Serum MPO therefore reflects neutrophil-driven oxidative inflammation and increased intestinal permeability, providing complementary information to tissue-level inflammatory assessments. Glutamine significantly elevated GSH and reduced MDA, consistent with its known effects on NF-κB suppression, apoptosis inhibition, and epithelial metabolic support. Arginine also modulated oxidative markers, although outcomes vary across models. HMB improved antioxidant defense and reduced mucosal inflammation, in line with earlier studies demonstrating its impact on autophagy, apoptosis, and macrophage polarization.

Glutamine and HMB promoted IL-10 expression and anti-inflammatory macrophage responses, whereas arginine influenced cytokine balance through nitric oxide–dependent immune modulation. The combined intervention integrated these mechanisms, resulting in broader cytokine network regulation rather than selective IL-6 suppression. IL-6 is a central cytokine in IBD pathogenesis and correlates with disease activity. DSS markedly increased IL-6 expression, confirming model severity. Glutamine and arginine significantly reduced IL-6, consistent with their ability to modulate epithelial repair and cytokine responses. HMB did not suppress IL-6, supporting the idea that it influences immune remodeling rather than initial inflammation. In the combination group, IL-6 remained moderately elevated, suggesting a regulatory rather than suppressive effect when nutrients are co-administered.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24186</offset><text>COX2, induced by IL-6 and TNF-α and elevated in colitis, was strongly upregulated in DSS animals. Glutamine and arginine suppressed COX2-consistent with their reported inhibition of COX2, iNOS, and other inflammatory mediators. Although IL-6 and COX2 expression remained moderately elevated in the combination group, this finding should not be interpreted as ongoing pathological inflammation. Both mediators exert context-dependent functions and are critically involved in epithelial restitution, angiogenesis, and wound healing during the resolution phase of colitis. The concurrent histopathological improvement reduced oxidative stress markers, and normalization of chemokine signaling suggest that IL-6 and COX2 activation in the combination group reflects a regulated reparative response rather than detrimental inflammation. In contrast, HMB and the mixture increased COX2, indicating that HMB acts through signaling pathways, such as NF-κB/MAPK, rather than directly inhibiting COX2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25186</offset><text>“Given the close interplay between amino acid metabolism, immune regulation, and gut microbial composition, future studies integrating microbiota profiling will be essential to determine whether the observed molecular and histological benefits of these immunonutrients are partially mediated through microbiome-dependent mechanisms.”</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25524</offset><text>NOS2/iNOS plays a dual role in IBD, contributing to both tissue damage and repair. Arginine is a substrate for both NOS2 and ARG2, and its effects depend on disease stage. Increased ARG2 and NOS2 in UC patients and DSS mice reflect oxidative stress responses. Glutamine reduces NOS2 expression via NF-κB/MAPK inhibition, and HMB may have similar effects. In our study, all treatments increased NOS2 to varying degrees; HMB induced the strongest expression, suggesting a role in adaptive nitric oxide–mediated repair.

ALDH4A1, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in proline degradation and glutamate generation, was markedly upregulated following HMB and combined supplementation. Given its role in redox regulation, mitochondrial metabolism, and aldehyde detoxification, increased ALDH4A1 expression likely reflects improved metabolic resilience and epithelial adaptation during colitis recovery. The restoration of ALDH4A1 may contribute to enhanced antioxidant capacity and energy homeostasis, supporting mucosal repair rather than directly suppressing inflammation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28306</offset><text>Integration with cytokine signaling and metabolic pathways through enrichment analysis identified IL-10 signaling, IL-4/IL-13 signaling, CD163-dependent anti-inflammatory responses, general interleukin signaling, and cytokine signaling in the immune system as key networks activated in colitis.

Individually, the amino acids improved selected components of the inflammatory response, oxidative balance, and metabolic stress, whereas the combined supplementation produced a more integrated and balanced modulation across these pathways. Glutamine most effectively improved antioxidant capacity and suppressed IL6 and COX2; arginine contributed to regulation of NO-related metabolism; and HMB enhanced ALDH4A1 expression and metabolic adaptation. The combination therapy generated broader but more moderate shifts in inflammatory gene expression and restored cytokine and metabolic network coherence, as supported by enrichment analyses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31442</offset><text>Together, these findings indicate that immunonutrition with arginine, glutamine, and HMB has therapeutic potential for mitigating colitis by targeting cytokine signaling, chemokine regulation, amino acid metabolism, and oxidative stress defense.
