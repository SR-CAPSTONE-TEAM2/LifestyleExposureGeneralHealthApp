Recent research suggests that an imbalance in gut bacteria (dysbiosis) may contribute to CFS symptoms by producing harmful substances that affect the nervous system. We investigated whether a specific multi-strain probiotic (CDS22-formula) could improve symptoms in women with CFS and co-occurring IBS. Over 12 weeks, patients took a high-dose probiotic supplement. We monitored their fatigue levels and analyzed urine samples to track changes in tryptophan metabolism—a key pathway linking the gut to the brain. The results showed that the probiotic intervention was associated with an improved gut bacteria profile. Importantly, this coincided with a reduction in neurotoxic metabolites and a significant decrease in fatigue severity. Our findings suggest that targeting the gut microbiome can be a valuable strategy for managing chronic fatigue, potentially by modulating the production of metabolites that affect brain function. </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1261</offset><text>Abstract</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1270</offset><text>Background/Objectives: Gut dysbiosis in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) drives low-grade inflammation and shifts tryptophan metabolism toward neurotoxic pathways. The causal link between bacterial translocation, kynurenine pathway dysregulation, and symptom severity remains under-defined. We evaluated the impact of a high-concentration multi-strain probiotic on the “gut-kynurenine axis” and clinical status in CFS patients with co-morbid IBS-U and confirmed dysbiosis. Methods: Forty female patients with confirmed dysbiosis (GA-map™ Dysbiosis Index &gt; 2) received the CDS22 formula (450 billion CFU/day) for 12 weeks. We compared urinary tryptophan metabolite profiles (LC-MS/MS), gut dysbiosis markers (3-indoxyl sulfate), and fatigue severity (FSS) against 40 age-matched healthy controls. Results: Baseline analysis revealed profound metabolic perturbations: elevated bacterial proteolytic markers (3-IS), substrate depletion (low tryptophan), and a neurotoxic signature (high quinolinic acid [QA], low kynurenic acid [KYNA]). Following the intervention, fatigue scores declined by 40.3%, with 97.5% of patients reaching the remission threshold (FSS &lt; 36). Biochemically, 3-IS levels decreased to the range observed in healthy controls and attenuated xanthurenic acid levels. Although absolute QA concentrations remained elevated compared to controls, the neuroprotective KYNA/QA ratio increased significantly (+45%). Increased systemic tryptophan availability correlated directly with clinical symptom reduction (Spearman’s rho = −0.36, p = 0.024). Conclusions: The CDS22 formulation was associated with a restoration of intestinal eubiosis and functional tryptophan partitioning. Clinical remission coincides with a metabolic shift favoring neuroprotection (increased KYNA/QA ratio), validating the gut–kynurenine axis as a modifiable therapeutic target. Peripheral metabolic improvement relative to the healthy baseline appeared sufficient for symptom relief in this specific phenotype, despite incomplete clearance of neurotoxic metabolites.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>3333</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3349</offset><text>Chronic fatigue manifests across various pathologies but serves as the primary, sometimes isolated, symptom of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Characterized by persistent or recurrent exhaustion, the syndrome’s diagnostic criteria have undergone repeated modification. While historical classifications framed CFS as a psychosomatic or inflammatory disorder, recent investigation has shifted toward gut microbiome alterations (dysbiosis). Despite this focus, a definitive causal relationship remains elusive.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3859</offset><text>Data regarding specific bacterial populations are inconsistent; studies have reported increases in both pro- and anti-inflammatory strains. A prevailing hypothesis posits that low-grade intestinal inflammation compromises barrier integrity, facilitating the translocation of bacterial and dietary antigens into the systemic circulation. Elevated serum antibacterial antibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines in CFS patients support this inflammatory model, yet evidence linking specific dysbiotic profiles to pathogenesis remains mixed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4396</offset><text>“Dysbiosis” is traditionally defined by quantitative shifts in bacterial composition, diversity, or the ratio of commensal to pathogenic species. However, taxonomic profiles do not always predict functional output. As indicated by our previous study, structural microbiome changes often fail to correlate with metabolic activity. While metagenomic assessments in CFS patients yield conflicting results—some showing species overgrowth, others depletion—metabolic markers paint a more consistent picture. Independent of specific bacterial abundance, metabolic assessments (hydrogen/methane breath tests) and urinary markers (hippuric acid, indoxyl) frequently indicate functional bacterial overgrowth. Crucially, this metabolic shift coincides with the overproduction of neurotoxic tryptophan metabolites, specifically xanthurenic and quinolinic acid. Since gut dysbiosis is a shared pathophysiological core linking enteric symptoms (IBS) with systemic neurotoxicity (CFS), we purposely recruited patients presenting with this overlapping phenotype to target the gut–brain axis directly.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5492</offset><text>These discrepancies between taxonomic structure and metabolic function necessitate a targeted therapeutic intervention. Probiotics, particularly those with anti-inflammatory properties, remain a primary treatment strategy. This study investigates the association between a high-concentration, multi-strain probiotic intervention (CDS22 formula) and the modulation of neuroactive tryptophan metabolites in CFS patients with co-occurring IBS-U. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether restoring gut eubiosis correlates with a shift from neurotoxic to neuroprotective kynurenine pathway activity and a reduction in fatigue severity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6126</offset><text>2.

Following detailed medical and laboratory evaluation, 33 candidates were excluded. The primary reasons for exclusion were chronic use of medications affecting the nervous system or gut motility (n = 12), ambiguous dysbiosis markers not meeting the threshold (n = 9), predominance of severe fibromyalgia pain (n = 7), and technical inability to comply with app-based monitoring (n = 3). Two additional patients declined participation. Ultimately, 40 female patients meeting all inclusion criteria were enrolled and completed the full 12-week intervention protocol. No dropouts or serious adverse events necessitating withdrawal were recorded. However, transient mild-to-moderate constipation and bloating were reported by 6 patients (15%) in the second week. These were successfully managed with temporary lactulose or macrogol supplementation (resolved within 3 days) without interrupting the probiotic regimen.

Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33012</offset><text>Current therapeutic strategies for CFS remain largely symptomatic. This reflects our incomplete understanding of the disease etiology. Crucially, in the specific subgroup of patients with co-occurring IBS, gut microbiome dysbiosis acts as a driver of low-grade inflammation, and the precise causal mechanisms are still debated. In this study, we demonstrated that a 12-week intervention with a multi-strain probiotic (De Simone Formulation) was associated with the correction of intestinal dysbiosis. More importantly, this microbiological improvement coincided with a functional shift in tryptophan metabolism that correlated with clinical symptom mitigation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33673</offset><text>Baseline analysis confirmed that our patients—specifically recruited with a dysbiotic/IBS phenotype—exhibited reduced alpha diversity and an increase in pro-inflammatory taxa. This was metabolically mirrored by elevated urinary 3-IS. This excessive 3-IS production is a direct marker of bacterial tryptophan catabolism and implies increased intestinal permeability (“leaky gut”). Probiotic treatment effectively reduced 3-IS levels to the reference range observed in healthy controls. This suggests that the epithelial barrier was restored and proteolytic bacterial species were suppressed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34272</offset><text>Our findings regarding the kynurenine pathway stand in contrast to some prevailing theories. Specifically, our patients exhibited elevated KYN/TRP ratios and high levels of downstream metabolites (XA, QA) at baseline. This indicates a robust activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Such data contradict the “Metabolic Trap” hypothesis, which assumes a functional block in IDO activity. Instead, our results support a model of chronic, immune-mediated IDO activation, likely driven by persistent dysbiosis. Tryptophan is essentially “stolen” from the serotonin pathway and shunted toward the kynurenine axis, leading to the observed substrate depletion, as illustrated in Figure 10.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34969</offset><text>The treatment effects were heterogeneous. We saw a robust reduction in xanthurenic acid (XA) and a marked increase in neuroprotective kynurenic acid (KYNA). However, quinolinic acid (QA) levels remained significantly elevated compared to controls. This persistence of QA, despite clear clinical improvement, is puzzling but interpretable. We argue that the absolute concentration of QA is less clinically relevant than its ratio to KYNA. Since the intervention increased KYNA by 35%, the KYNA/QA ratio improved by nearly 45%. This suggests a functional neuroprotective blockade: the “antidote” (KYNA) increased enough to neutralize the neurotoxin (QA).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35626</offset><text>It is also possible that QA clearance is simply slower.

However, symptom resolution was not uniform. While fatigue and muscle pain improved, sleep disturbances persisted in the majority of the cohort. This suggests that peripheral metabolic realignment is sufficient to relieve physical fatigue, but central sleep regulation may require more targeted support. We also noted that 15% of patients developed constipation. While Bifidobacteria usually improve transit, alterations in serotonin availability via TRP metabolism changes can evidently affect motility in some individuals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36539</offset><text>A critical consideration in interpreting these findings is the distinction between subjective symptom relief and objective metabolic modulation. While the reduction in FSS observed in this open-label trial could theoretically be influenced by the placebo effect or the natural fluctuation of chronic illness, the biochemical data suggest a specific biological mechanism of action. The placebo response typically manifests as a generalized stress reduction, potentially lowering cortisol-mediated TDO activation, but it is unlikely to induce the highly specific pattern of enzymatic shifts observed here—namely, the simultaneous upregulation of kynurenic acid and downregulation of xanthurenic acid. Furthermore, the significant reduction in urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate constitutes a microbiological marker of gut barrier integrity that is independent of host psychology. Thus, while the magnitude of clinical benefit should be viewed with caution given the study design, the consistency of the tryptophan pathway modulation provides strong evidence for a physiological, rather than purely psychogenic, effect of the intervention.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37669</offset><text>This study has limitations. First, while the sample size (n = 40) is relatively modest compared to large-scale population studies, the large effect sizes observed (Cliff’s δ &gt; 0.47; rrb &gt; 0.50) confirm that the study possessed sufficient statistical power to validate the primary metabolic endpoints. Secondly, it was an open-label trial, introducing potential placebo bias. Nevertheless, the rigorous quantification of objective biochemical markers provides a solid physiological basis for the observed changes. Also, measurements were restricted to urine; cerebrospinal fluid analysis would be needed to confirm central neurochemistry changes. Moreover, we strictly excluded confounding factors like high-protein diet or hormonal contraceptives, which strengthens the validity of our metabolic findings. Consistent with this rigorous control, the study cohort was restricted exclusively to female participants. While this decision increased internal validity by minimizing the confounding influence of sex hormones on tryptophan metabolism, it limits the generalizability of our findings to the male CFS population. Thirdly, although macronutrient and tryptophan intake were controlled, the study did not strictly monitor dietary FODMAP content. As fermentable carbohydrates can influence gut microbiota activity and IBS symptoms, unmeasured variations in FODMAP intake remain a potential confounding factor. Finally, the durability of the observed metabolic shift after cessation of probiotic supplementation remains unknown. Future longitudinal studies are required to determine whether continuous supplementation is necessary to maintain the neuroprotective KYNA/QA balance.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>39353</offset><text>5.
