We have recently shown that a systemic deficiency of taurine, a semi-essential amino acid with anti-inflammatory properties, marks IBD. To characterize the temporal dynamics and determinants of taurine deficiency in IBD, we conducted a prospective longitudinal study assessing serum taurine levels in a cohort of 47 patients with IBD compared with 33 healthy controls. Serum taurine concentrations were measured at baseline and after a median follow-up period of 45 months using ELISA. Patients were stratified by disease subtype (UC and CD), age group, and clinical activity status at baseline and follow-up. Serum taurine levels were significantly lower in IBD patients at both baseline and the end of follow-up (p &lt; 0.05), and remained stable over time within the CD and UC cohorts. In healthy individuals, but not in IBD patients, taurine concentrations declined with age, suggesting that age-related metabolic regulation of taurine is altered in the context of chronic intestinal inflammation. Stratification by disease activity revealed that taurine deficiency was present in both active and inactive IBD, particularly among younger patients, and differences between active and inactive disease were minimal. These findings indicate that the persistent reduction in serum taurine in IBD is independent of age, disease subtype, or clinical activity, and remains relatively constant over time across most patient subgroups, suggesting an underlying alteration in taurine metabolism or homeostasis associated with IBD pathophysiology. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms linking taurine dysregulation to IBD progression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2040</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2056</offset><text>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), primarily ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), are long-standing disorders driven by dysregulated innate and T- and B-cell-mediated adaptive immune responses within the gastrointestinal tract. This chronic inflammatory state constitutes significant challenges for treatment, long-term disease management, and patients’ quality of life. Although IBD clinical presentation and underlying mechanisms vary, both CD and UC share a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, and microbial factors that contribute to chronic intestinal inflammation. Increasing attention has been directed toward the metabolic disturbances that accompany IBD and may influence disease progression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2813</offset><text>One such metabolic alteration involves taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cytoprotective roles. Thanks to its properties, taurine is thought to play an important role in modulating gut inflammation and maintaining epithelial barrier function, both of which are compromised in IBD. Taurine is primarily synthesized in the liver from cysteine and methionine via the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway, and can also be obtained from dietary sources such as meat and fish. It participates in bile acid conjugation, osmoregulation, and the modulation of calcium signaling, and is rapidly taken up by tissues through specific transporters, highlighting the tight regulation of its metabolism. Reduced circulating taurine has been reported in individuals with IBD, yet the factors driving this depletion and its temporal characteristics remain poorly understood. Earlier work from our group suggested that taurine levels may fluctuate with disease activity in UC but not in CD, suggesting potential differences in metabolic responses between the two disease subtypes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3925</offset><text>To clarify the evolution and determinants of taurine deficiency in IBD, this longitudinal study tracks serum taurine concentrations in patients with UC and CD and compares them with those in healthy individuals. By examining changes over time and across age groups, we aim to determine whether taurine depletion reflects active inflammation or indicates a persistent metabolic alteration in IBD. Insights from this work may deepen our understanding of IBD pathophysiology and help identify novel metabolic targets for future therapeutic strategies, including potential metabolic interventions or taurine-based supplementation approaches.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4563</offset><text>2.

In contrast, age-related differences were not observed in the IBD cohort: younger patients (&lt;50 years) already exhibited significantly lower taurine levels compared with age-matched controls, and older patients (≥50 years) did not show further decline. These results indicate that taurine deficiency in IBD is independent of age and cannot be attributed to the slightly younger mean age of the control cohort.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11598</offset><text>Within the IBD population, both CD and UC patients had reduced levels compared with controls, and taurine did not differ significantly between baseline and follow-up in either group. Stratification by clinical disease activity revealed that active IBD patients had similar levels of taurine to those measured in patients who were in remission. Moreover, within each age group, active and inactive patients showed comparable taurine concentrations. Collectively, these results suggest that taurine deficiency in IBD is not driven by clinical disease activity. Potential factors contributing to taurine reduction were explored in our previous study, including body mass index, dietary intake of taurine-rich foods, and consumption of taurine-containing energy drinks. None of these factors significantly influenced circulating taurine levels. It is therefore plausible that the taurine deficiency may stem from chronic metabolic adaptations to long-standing intestinal inflammation, increased utilization in oxidative-stress defense pathways, altered microbial metabolism, and/or impaired endogenous biosynthesis. Future investigations evaluating mucosal taurine metabolism, as well as the activity of enzymes such as cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase, are warranted to clarify whether defects in this biosynthetic route directly contribute to systemic taurine reduction in IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12978</offset><text>Metabolites function as key regulators of immune activity, intestinal homeostasis, and inflammatory signaling, thereby linking metabolic disturbances to IBD pathology. Among these metabolites, amino acids play particularly complex and influential roles in shaping immune responses and maintaining gut function. Tryptophan, an essential amino acid, is of special interest because it can be processed through three major metabolic routes, the kynurenine, serotonin, and microbial indole pathways, each yielding bioactive compounds with distinct immunological effects. In the kynurenine pathway, metabolites can activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), fostering regulatory T-cell development and limiting the proinflammatory actions of pathogenic T cells, ultimately helping to restrain intestinal inflammation. Yet, individuals with IBD frequently show disruptions in tryptophan metabolism, including increased kynurenine levels that correlate with heightened disease activity and inflammatory burden. Microbial conversion of tryptophan also generates indole derivatives with protective functions. For example, indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) has been shown to strengthen epithelial barrier integrity and reduce inflammation via AhR-dependent mechanisms. The clinical significance of taurine reduction in IBD is supported by its known roles in modulating inflammation, protecting against oxidative stress, regulating mitochondrial function, and maintaining epithelial barrier integrity, which are central to IBD pathophysiology. Indeed, previous experimental studies have demonstrated that taurine supplementation can mitigate gut inflammation and restore immune balance. It is therefore conceivable that persistent taurine deficiency may contribute to disease progression through increased oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and immune dysregulation. These results align with earlier reports documenting decreased circulating taurine concentrations in individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, in type 2 diabetes mellitus, several studies report significantly reduced serum taurine levels, which have been associated with complications such as diabetic neuropathy and endothelial dysfunction. Chronic kidney disease and patients on dialysis frequently show reduced circulating taurine, likely due to increased renal loss and altered metabolism. Experimental and clinical data suggest that taurine depletion in these contexts may contribute to oxidative stress and inflammatory dysregulation, while supplementation could exert cytoprotective effects. In contrast, some studies of acute coronary syndromes indicate elevated serum taurine, possibly reflecting tissue release or compensatory protective mechanisms. In this context, it is also noteworthy that a recent study reported a marked increase in taurine and hypotaurine metabolic pathways in the intestinal tissues of patients with IBD compared with healthy individuals. The researchers also observed that higher intestinal taurine levels were associated with reduced disease severity. Supporting this protective role, deletion of the taurine-biosynthesis gene CSAD worsened dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice, whereas taurine supplementation mitigated the intestinal inflammation, further reinforcing the potential relevance of taurine metabolism in IBD pathophysiology.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>16335</offset><text>4.

Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19942</offset><text>Our study demonstrates that the persistent reduction in serum taurine in IBD is independent of age, disease subtype, or clinical activity, confirming and extending previous observations of taurine deficiency in IBD. This study has several limitations, including the relatively small sample size and the lack of endoscopic or histological data, which limited the evaluation of disease activity to clinical scores. Additionally, disease duration was not considered in the analyses. The observational design also precluded establishing a causal link between taurine deficiency and dietary intake or other lifestyle factors, although we have previously shown no association between serum taurine reduction and such factors. Future studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms of taurine metabolism in IBD, as well as whether taurine supplementation can modulate mucosal inflammation and/or improve intestinal barrier function. Understanding how taurine deficiency contributes to disease progression and pathophysiology may inform new strategies for metabolic intervention and support the development of targeted therapies in IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>21072</offset><text>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
