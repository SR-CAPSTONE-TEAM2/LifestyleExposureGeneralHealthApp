Despite their increasing use in clinical practice, evidence in the pediatric population remains limited, especially regarding therapeutic exposure thresholds and the clinical utility of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Methods: We report a series of five pediatric cases with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis treated with ustekinumab or vedolizumab after anti-TNFα failure. Trough drug concentrations, anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), clinical scores (PCDAI/PUCAI), biomarkers (fecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein), and endoscopic findings were assessed longitudinally. Results: In all cases, we observed recurrent discordance between clinical indices (PCDAI/PUCAI), biochemical markers, and endoscopic activity. Clinical improvement frequently correlated with trough concentrations above commonly cited adult-derived reference ranges (&gt;15 µg/mL for vedolizumab; &gt;3 µg/mL for ustekinumab), although this alignment was not uniform across patients. Notably, one patient developed high-titre ADAs with undetectable ustekinumab levels, yet remained clinically stable, suggesting substantial interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and disease control. Conclusions: Ustekinumab and vedolizumab are promising off-label options for pediatric refractory IBD. In this case series, TDM contributed to the interpretation of pharmacokinetic variability and immunogenicity, offering contextual insights that may support dose adjustments and therapeutic decision-making. Integrating TDM with clinical, biochemical, and endoscopic monitoring may improve optimize individualized treatment in this complex and vulnerable patient group.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1970</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1986</offset><text>The introduction of anti–tumor necrosis factor α therapy (anti-TNFα) has fundamentally transformed the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), by achieving satisfactory clinical responses in a significant portion of patients, including long-term remission. Over the past decades, the cumulative five-year exposure to anti-TNFα agents has risen to more than 50%, reflecting their increasingly central role in clinical practice. This widespread use has been linked to a reduction in the risk of intestinal resections, with cohort studies reporting significantly lower hazard ratios for surgery among patients receiving early anti-TNFα therapy. Moreover, in patients with symptomatic strictures, anti-TNFα treatment may delay or, in some cases, avert the need for operative intervention. Nonetheless, the benefit in terms of preventing stricture formation is not consistently demonstrated across studies, and the overall decline in resection rates observed in recent decades is likely influenced by additional factors, including earlier diagnosis, multidisciplinary management, and optimized therapeutic strategies. Despite these advances, important therapeutic challenges persist, particularly in pediatric patients who are refractory or intolerant to anti-TNFα therapy, underscoring the ongoing need for alternative therapeutic options. The most considered alternatives for these vulnerable patients are vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks T-cell trafficking to the gastrointestinal tract, and ustekinumab, an inhibitor of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 (IL-12/23). Emerging evidence suggests that these agents may be effective in children with severe treatment-refractory disease, although the available data remain limited. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been proposed as a strategy to optimize biologic therapy in this complex population. By measuring drug concentrations and detecting ADAs, TDM allow for individualized dose adjustments and the early identification of immunogenicity. However, for newer biologics such as ustekinumab and vedolizumab, the available literature provides limited evidence regarding optimal dosing strategies, target drug concentrations, and the achievement of adequate trough levels. In adult patients, achieving therapeutic drug levels of these agents has been associated with higher rates of clinical remission and sustained response, suggesting potential benefits might be achievable in pediatric populations. Consequently, the application of TDM in children could therefore facilitate timely identification of primary non-response or secondary loss of response, allowing dose optimization or early therapeutic switching.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4697</offset><text>In this context, we present our experience with five pediatric patients with IBD who were refractory to anti-TNFα therapy and subsequently received vedolizumab or ustekinumab.

Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12701</offset><text>This case series provides a descriptive overview of the real-world use of vedolizumab and ustekinumab in pediatric patients with IBD refractory to anti-TNFα therapy. Although limited by sample size, the cases illustrate the complexity of managing second- and third-line biologics in children, particularly regarding pharmacokinetic variability, immunogenicity, and the frequent discordance between clinical symptoms, biochemical markers, and mucosal disease activity. A recurring observation across the presented cases was the discordance between clinical symptoms and biochemical or endoscopic findings. Several patients exhibited low PCDAI or PUCAI scores despite elevated fecal calprotectin or active endoscopic inflammation. This highlights the limitations of symptom-based assessment alone and supports the importance of a multidimensional monitoring approach that combines clinical indices with biomarkers and, when feasible, endoscopy evaluation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13659</offset><text>Within this complex landscape, TDM contributed to the interpretation of treatment response, particularly when subtherapeutic exposure or suspected immunogenicity was present. In Cases 1–3, TDM supported dose escalation strategies in response to subtherapeutic trough concentration. These observations align with emerging pediatric data suggesting that standard dosing regimens may be insufficient for a substantial proportion of children, who often require shortened intervals or higher maintenance doses to achieve adequate exposure. However, given that current exposure thresholds are largely extrapolated from adult cohorts, the interpretation of TDM in children must remain cautious and contextual. In contrast, Case 5 demonstrated high-titre anti-ustekinumab antibodies associated with undetectable drug levels, despite the patient maintaining a stable clinical condition. This case may illustrate the complex interplay between pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and disease control. While ADAs are generally associated with reduced therapeutic efficacy, their presence does not necessarily predict clinical failure, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may sustain remission in certain patients. Several mechanisms may contribute to this variability, including differences in antibody neutralizing capacity, residual tissue-level drug activity, or disease phenotypes less dependent on IL-12/23 signaling. Such findings emphasize that TDM and ADA testing, while informative, cannot be interpreted in isolation and must be integrated with clinical, biochemical, and endoscopic data.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15249</offset><text>Endoscopic findings in several cases (e.g., Cases 1 and 4) confirmed persistent mucosal inflammation despite apparent clinical improvement and/or increased drug levels, reinforcing the notion that clinical remission alone does not necessarily equate to disease control. These observations may align with previous reports suggesting that some patients in apparent remission could still to exhibit subclinical disease activity detectable only through biomarkers or endoscopy. Given that endoscopy is invasive and not routinely performable during follow-up, the identification of reliable non-invasive markers of mucosal healing remains a clinical priority. Fecal calprotectin remains the most widely used surrogate, but its limitations in pediatrics are well recognized. In this regard, TDM could provide complementary information, particularly when integrated with ADA testing and clinical scores.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16146</offset><text>Therapeutic thresholds for ustekinumab and vedolizumab in the pediatric population remain to be clearly established. Current target concentrations are largely extrapolated from adult data, but pediatric pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may differ due to developmental, immunological, and disease-related factors. Data from recent pediatric cohorts indicate that 35–50% of patients may exhibit subtherapeutic trough concentrations during early treatment, highlighting the potential value of proactive TDM to guide early dose optimization. Several studies have also shown that standard dosing regimens are frequently inadequate in children, necessitating intravenous induction, dose intensification, or shortened dosing intervals to achieve therapeutic targets. These observations are consistent with our clinical experience, in which proactive adjustments were often required. Notably, Case 5 maintained clinical stability despite undetectable drug levels, suggesting considerable inter-individual variability in pharmacodynamic response and underscoring the need for personalized treatment approaches.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17255</offset><text>The clinical relevance of ADAs, though infrequent with ustekinumab, requires particular attention. In Case 5, persistent high-titre ADAs were observed alongside sustained clinical remission, suggesting that the relationship between immunogenicity and treatment response is not linear. While persistent ADAs have generally been associated with lower drug concentrations and poorer clinical outcomes, transient ADAs appear to exert only a limited and often clinically irrelevant impact. This discrepancy could reflect compensatory immunological mechanisms, residual drug activity at tissue level, or a disease phenotype less dependent on IL-12/23 pathways. It also underscores the importance of interpreting ADA results within an integrated clinical and biochemical context, rather than relying solely on pharmacokinetic data.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18080</offset><text>The interpretation of TDM in this setting is also subject to several important limitations. Assay-related variability must be considered, as ELISA-based platforms differ in analytical sensitivity, calibration curves, and drug–antibody interference, potentially affecting the comparability of trough concentrations across studies. Inflammation-driven changes in drug clearance, particularly during active disease, may lead to lower trough levels independently of dosing adequacy, complicating the distinction between true underexposure and disease-related pharmacokinetic alterations. Moreover, pediatric pharmacokinetics are strongly influenced by inflammatory burden, nutritional status, and concomitant therapies, all of which may alter drug clearance and confound the interpretation of trough concentrations. The absence of validated pediatric therapeutic thresholds further limits the ability to define exposure–response relationships with confidence. These factors highlight the need for cautious, context-dependent interpretation of TDM results.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19136</offset><text>Overall, our findings suggest that the combined use of TDM and biomarker assessment may support clinical decision-making in selected pediatric patients treated with vedolizumab or ustekinumab, particularly when the clinical picture is atypical or the therapeutic response appears suboptimal. Although the potential value of TDM is increasingly recognized, its application is currently more feasible during induction, when pharmacokinetic variability is greatest and therapeutic objectives are clearly defined. In contrast, monitoring during maintenance often remains reactive, constrained by the absence of reliable surrogate markers of disease activity and by the practical limitations of routine pediatric care.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19850</offset><text>Interpretation of the TDM results in this setting requires careful consideration of multiple confounding factors that influence both drug exposure and clinical response.

Patients were followed from May 2022 to June 2023 with monthly or bimonthly follow-up visits during which clinical and biochemical data were collected. Patients had a prior diagnosis of Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) based on the revised Porto criteria of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). Demographic and clinical data were collected, including age at diagnosis, disease localization, and behavior according to the Paris classification. For each patient, clinical disease activity was assessed using the Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) for CD and the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) for UC at baseline (prior to ustekinumab or vedolizumab therapy initiation), at each TDM assessment, and at the end of follow-up. Clinical remission was defined as PCDAI and PUCAI scores ≤ 10. Clinical response was defined as a decrease in PCDAI by 12.5 points or in PUCAI by 10 points. Laboratory data, including serum hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), albumin, and fecal calprotectin (FC), were collected for all patients. For the descriptive clinical interpretation of TDM results, trough concentrations (TC) &gt; 15 µg/mL for vedolizumab and &gt;3 µg/mL for ustekinumab were considered indicative of adequate drug exposure. These thresholds were selected based on established exposure–response data in adult cohorts and emerging evidence in the pediatric population, serving as clinical reference points to guide dose optimization rather than absolute therapeutic targets, as definitive pediatric thresholds are yet to be fully established.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22832</offset><text>Data on clinical management (i.e., treatment intensification, agents like steroids, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) as well as available endoscopic assessments were recorded.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>23012</offset><text>4.1.
