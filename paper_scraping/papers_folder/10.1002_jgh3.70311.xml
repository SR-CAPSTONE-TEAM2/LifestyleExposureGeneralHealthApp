Full‐term delivery occurred in 82.6%, with 13% preterm births and 4.4% abortions; Cesarean section rate was 46.7%. Women who received therapy during pregnancy had significantly better outcomes than those who were untreated (OR = 3.4, p = 0.028).

The exact cause of IBD remains elusive, but it is believed to result from a combination of immune dysregulation, altered intestinal microbiota, and genetic predisposition. In 2005, the Montreal World Congress of Gastroenterology revised the classification of IBD into three main groups: Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and IBD‐unclassified (IBD‐U). CD involves transmural inflammation affecting any part of the gastrointestinal tract, while UC is characterized by episodic inflammation limited to the mucosal lining of the colon in an ascending pattern. IBD‐U is used when there is clinical and endoscopic evidence of chronic inflammation of the colon, but without small bowel involvement, and without definitive histological features distinguishing CD from UC.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3166</offset><text>The prevalence of IBD has significantly increased over the past three decades, placing a substantial economic and social burden on patients and healthcare systems. In 2017, an estimated 6.8 million patients were diagnosed with IBD, compared to 3.7 million in 1990. Moreover, the number of years lived with disability nearly doubled during this period. A systematic analysis of the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study revealed that the prevalence of IBD varies across different geographical areas and ethnicities. Regions with higher sociodemographic indices tend to have a higher prevalence. The age‐standardized prevalence rate of IBD was highest in North America (422 per 100 000 population) and lowest in the Caribbean (6.7 per 100 000 population).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3928</offset><text>It is also noteworthy that the onset of IBD often occurs in young patients under the age of 35, raising concerns about the potential risk of disease flare during pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and the safe use of medications. Pregnancy brings about unique physiological, immunological, and hormonal changes that interact with inflammatory conditions like IBD. Women with IBD face higher risks of anemia and nutritional deficiencies due to potent immunomodulatory medications, previous abdominal surgeries, adhesions, or rectovaginal fistulas. The placenta plays a crucial role in pregnancy's physiological immunomodulation, favoring T helper 2 cells for fetal protection. During pregnancy, the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) surge is associated with ameliorating inflammatory reactions. However, the impact of estrogen and progesterone on IBD's progression remains uncertain. Lastly, changes in the gut microbiome during pregnancy can have complex, potentially beneficial effects on IBD's course.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4934</offset><text>Early studies indicated that CD was less affected by pregnancy compared to UC, with a correlation between disease flare risk and the level of disease activity at conception. However, a 10‐year follow‐up study of 266 women with IBD found that pregnancy was associated with a lower number of disease flares in the subsequent years. On the other hand, pregnant women with IBD may be at higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortions, premature birth, low birth weight, and cesarean sections . Reviews summarizing fertility and pregnancy outcomes in IBD confirm that disease activity is the key determinant of maternal and neonatal risk. Current international guidelines emphasize preconception counseling and continuation of maintenance therapy to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with IBD. However, much of the existing literature on pregnancy outcomes in IBD predates the increased use of biological agents and recent advancements in IBD management. Moreover, most studies have been conducted in Western countries, lacking research on the interaction between IBD and pregnancy in general and the Gulf region in particular.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6106</offset><text>Given the improved medical therapeutics and increased adoption of biological agents, we hypothesize that the course of IBD and pregnancy outcomes for women with IBD is more favorable now.

It also included disease characteristics like the type of IBD, disease duration, history of surgery, and disease activity at conception and during pregnancy. Additionally, medication use was recorded, including the use of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics before and during pregnancy. Pregnancy‐related variables were also collected, such as the number of pregnancies, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, complications like gestational diabetes or preeclampsia, and antenatal hospitalizations. Finally, pregnancy outcomes were assessed, including live birth, miscarriage, preterm birth (defined as less than 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. Unfavorable pregnancy outcomes were defined as having any of the following: abortion, extra‐uterine pregnancy, stillbirth, preterm delivery, neonatal death, and low birth weight. Disease activity was assessed using clinical notes, laboratory results (e.g., C‐reactive protein, fecal calprotectin), and endoscopic or imaging data when available. CD activity was evaluated using the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), while UC disease activity was measured using the Mayo score.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9324</offset><text>Data Management Plan</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9345</offset><text>All collected data were entered into a secure, password‐protected database accessible only to the research team.

Most participants experienced remission throughout the pregnancy trimesters (88.1%–89.2%) but declined slightly at 6 months postpartum (81.7%). Mild disease activity remained low during pregnancy but increased from 5.4% to 9.8% postpartum. Moderate disease was infrequent and peaked during the second and third trimesters. Severe disease was rare, reported in only one case during the first and second trimesters. Regarding therapy, immunomodulators (oral 5‐ASA, topical 5‐ASA, azathioprine, and mercaptopurine) were the most frequently used alone, followed by biological therapies (including infliximab, adalimumab, Ustekinumab, certolizumab pegol, and vedolizumab). Combination therapies were employed less frequently during the trimesters. Interestingly, the therapy types remained consistent throughout the trimesters, indicating a stable treatment regimen (Table 3).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">jgh370311-tbl-0002.xml</infon><infon key="id">jgh370311-tbl-0002</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>14182</offset><text>Disease activity during conception, pregnancy and postpartum (N = 97).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">jgh370311-tbl-0002.xml</infon><infon key="id">jgh370311-tbl-0002</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

Cesarean section (46.7%) was the most prevalent delivery method. Congenital anomalies were uncommon (3.1%), and the average birth weight was 3018 g (SD = 630), with most babies having a normal birth weight (79.5%) (Table 4). As illustrated in Table 5, the relationship between disease characteristics and pregnancy outcomes was inconclusive. Neither UC nor CD significantly influenced the outcomes, nor did the location of the disease. Moreover, prior gastrointestinal surgery and perianal or rectovaginal fistula did not demonstrate a notable impact on pregnancy outcomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">jgh370311-tbl-0004.xml</infon><infon key="id">jgh370311-tbl-0004</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>16046</offset><text>Pregnancy outcome among study participants (N = 97).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">jgh370311-tbl-0004.xml</infon><infon key="id">jgh370311-tbl-0004</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

Patients who received therapy had a higher likelihood of unfavorable pregnancy outcomes compared to those without treatment (OR = 3.4, p = 0.028). At conception, neither monotherapy (OR 2.8, p = 0.160) nor combination therapy (OR 2.6, p = 0.265) was significantly associated with pregnancy outcome. In the first trimester, monotherapy significantly reduced the odds of unfavorable outcomes (OR 4.8, p = 0.025), while combination therapy showed a protective trend that did not reach statistical significance (OR 4.4, p = 0.051). In the second trimester, both monotherapy (OR 4.1, p = 0.041) and combination therapy (OR 6.3, p = 0.024) were significantly protective. Similarly, in the third trimester, monotherapy (OR 4.2, p = 0.037) and combination therapy (OR 6.0, p = 0.028) remained significantly associated with favorable pregnancy outcomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">jgh370311-tbl-0006.xml</infon><infon key="id">jgh370311-tbl-0006</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>18575</offset><text>The relationship between the type of therapy received during conception and pregnancy and the pregnancy outcome (N = 97).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">jgh370311-tbl-0006.xml</infon><infon key="id">jgh370311-tbl-0006</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

Most participants were in remission at conception and throughout pregnancy, with remission rates between 88.1% and 89.2%. However, remission declined to 81.7% by 6 months postpartum, with a slight increase in mild disease activity. Severe disease was rare. Favorable pregnancy outcomes were common, with 82.6% of births at full term and low rates of congenital anomalies (3.1%) and low birth weight (15.9%). Favorable pregnancy outcomes were common, and no significant differences were observed between women with UC and those with CD. Importantly, overall therapy exposure during pregnancy was associated with significantly better outcomes compared to no treatment (p = 0.028), confirming that active management during gestation is beneficial. Treatment received during pregnancy, whether monotherapy or combination therapy, demonstrated protective effects beginning in the first trimester and becoming statistically significant thereafter. These findings emphasize that treatment, regardless of type or trimester, was significantly associated with improved outcomes, even after accounting for disease activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22849</offset><text>Most patients were in clinical remission during conception and throughout pregnancy, which is consistent with previous findings that suggest pregnancy may exert a stabilizing effect on IBD, especially when patients enter pregnancy in remission. However, a slight decline in remission rates was noted postpartum, echoing reports from previous studies that disease activity may increase after delivery, particularly in patients with UC. According to van der Giessen et al., pregnancy modulates IBD activity through several mechanisms. First, the maternal immune system shifts toward a Th2‐dominant response to support fetal tolerance, which helps suppress inflammation in Th1‐driven diseases like CD. Additionally, pregnancy promotes the expansion of regulatory T cells, enhancing immune tolerance and reducing intestinal inflammation. Elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy also exert anti‐inflammatory effects. Together, these changes create a more controlled immune environment that can lead to clinical remission or improvement of IBD symptoms, particularly when the disease is well‐managed before conception. After delivery, the immune system shifts back to a Th1‐dominant state, regulatory T cell levels drop, and anti‐inflammatory hormones like estrogen and progesterone decrease each contributing to increased inflammation. Concurrently, postpartum changes in the gut microbiome can destabilize the intestinal environment. These findings underscore the importance of close monitoring postpartum for IBD flare.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24401</offset><text>In terms of neonatal outcomes, our study showed that the majority of neonates were born full‐term (82.6%) with a mean birth weight of 3018 g, and low birth weight occurred in 15.9% of cases. These figures are comparable to or slightly better than those reported in previous IBD studies, where preterm delivery rates have ranged from 10% to 20% and low birth weight rates from 15% to 25%. In the general Qatari population, the preterm birth rate is approximately 8.5%, and low birth weight affects about 8%–10% of neonates, suggesting a slightly higher burden among women with IBD. The rate of abortion in our cohort was 4.4%, which is within global estimates for early pregnancy loss in the general population (10%–15%). Congenital anomalies were rare (3.1%), aligning with the general population risk of 2%–4%, and no significant associations were found between medication exposure and congenital abnormalities. These findings reinforce the importance of maintaining disease control during pregnancy to mitigate neonatal risks while supporting the safety of IBD therapies in this context.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25501</offset><text>We analyzed therapy exposure during pregnancy by comparing women who received no treatment to those who received any form of therapy, regardless of trimester or regimen type. This comparison demonstrated that women who continued therapy during pregnancy had significantly better outcomes than those who remained untreated (p = 0.028). Although the study design and limited sample size did not allow for multivariable adjustment, this finding reinforces the clinical importance of maintaining IBD therapy during pregnancy. While our analysis cannot confirm whether this beneficial effect is independent of disease control, the results are consistent with existing evidence suggesting that active disease, rather than therapy exposure itself, drives most adverse pregnancy outcomes. Noncompliance may lead to disease flares, which increase the risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and miscarriage. Brondfield and Mahadevan emphasize that active disease poses a greater risk to both mother and fetus than any potential harm from maintenance therapy. Therefore, counseling and reassurance regarding medication safety remain critical components of preconception and antenatal care for women with IBD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26705</offset><text>Importantly, neither the type of IBD (UC, CD, or IBD‐U) nor the anatomical location significantly influenced pregnancy outcomes. This is in line with findings from Cornish et al., who reported no significant difference in adverse pregnancy outcomes between UC and CD patients when disease is well controlled. Similarly, prior gastrointestinal surgery and perianal disease did not appear to significantly impact maternal or neonatal outcomes, indicating that with proper disease control, these factors may not pose substantial additional risks in pregnancy. Importantly, disease activity was a strong predictor of pregnancy outcomes. Active disease at conception and during later trimesters was significantly associated with unfavorable outcomes, consistent with existing literature emphasizing that active IBD increases risks of preterm birth, low birth weight, and other complications. This underscores the need for proactive disease monitoring and management, particularly in women planning pregnancy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27712</offset><text>In the present study, the analysis of therapy patterns indicates that both monotherapy and combination therapy during pregnancy exhibited protective effects, particularly from the second trimester onwards. This finding reinforces the argument for maintaining therapy throughout pregnancy, irrespective of the chosen regimen, as discontinuation was consistently associated with diminished outcomes. Our findings align with current European consensus recommendations supporting the safety of immunomodulators and biologics in pregnancy when clinically indicated. Notably, patients who received no treatment had poorer outcomes, particularly in the first trimester. Furthermore, the proportion of women in our cohort receiving biological therapy was higher than in previous European studies. For instance, Pedersen et al. reported biologic use in only 11.5% of pregnant women with IBD, whereas 33% of our population received biological therapy during the second and third trimesters. This disparity may reflect a growing acceptance of biologic safety in pregnancy and increased accessibility in high‐resource settings like Qatar.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28842</offset><text>Our study presents novel data from a Gulf population, contributing to the limited literature in this region. Most women in this study were multiparous, with a longer duration of IBD prior to pregnancy, and a higher percentage of biological therapy use. A major strength of this study is its focus on real‐world clinical data from a tertiary care center, which provides a practical understanding of pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD in a controlled but diverse population. Additionally, detailed patient‐level data allowed assessment of various clinical variables, including disease activity at multiple time points, medication use, and disease phenotype. Nonetheless, the study has limitations including retrospective design that may introduce selection and information bias. The sample size, although reasonable, limits the statistical power for subgroup analyses, particularly for evaluating rare outcomes or less common medication exposures. To address sparse data in some subgroups, therapies were grouped into monotherapy and combination categories, which improved interpretability but reduced granularity. The independent effects of treatment and IBD activity could not be fully distinguished in multivariable analyses due to collinearity among treatment exposures and disease activity. Nevertheless, reporting the trimester‐specific analyses provided valuable temporal insights into treatment effects.

Both monotherapy and combination therapy during pregnancy were consistently protective, particularly in the second and third trimesters, while therapy at conception alone was not significantly associated with outcomes. These findings have important clinical implications. Preconception counseling should be an integral part of care, reassuring patients of the safety and necessity of medical treatment during pregnancy to avoid disease flares. Multidisciplinary collaboration between gastroenterologists, obstetricians, and maternal‐fetal medicine specialists is essential to optimize maternal and neonatal health. Women with IBD should receive individualized care plans that include close disease monitoring, medication review, and proactive management. Lastly, the study underscores the need for prospective research in the region using standardized disease activity indices and long‐term follow‐up of maternal and child outcomes to enhance evidence‐based care.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>31617</offset><text>Funding</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31625</offset><text>This research was funded by the Medical Research Center of Hamad Medical Corporation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>31711</offset><text>Ethics Statement</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31728</offset><text>Ethical approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at Hamad Medical Corporation (MRC‐01‐24‐021).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>31868</offset><text>Consent</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31876</offset><text>The need for consent was waived by the ethical committee.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">COMP_INT</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>31934</offset><text>Conflicts of Interest</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">COMP_INT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31956</offset><text>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>32002</offset><text>Data Availability Statement</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32030</offset><text>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>32148</offset><text>References</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">749</infon><infon key="issue">6</infon><infon key="lpage">753</infon><infon key="pub-id_doi">10.1136/gut.2005.082909</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">16698746</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Gut</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="volume">55</infon><infon key="year">2006</infon><offset>32159</offset><text>The Montreal Classification of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Controversies, Consensus, and Implications</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">458</infon><infon key="issue">6</infon><infon key="lpage">466</infon><infon key="pub-id_doi">10.1038/nri2340</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Nature Reviews.
